1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,336
Where can I get something

2
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:51,968
We should make a display

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,576
Also my cat are you serious camera it's now 10 appears

4
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Scratch

5
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
Bad

6
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Ok

7
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Existing

8
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
Uvc camera camera one

9
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,080
Christine would you mind at least popping it open on a laptop so you can moderate chat

10
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,088
Plugging the webcam in a different for here

11
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
90s live

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,072
People in my liver offline now

13
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Hey there is a uvc camera now

14
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Do you have a laptop

15
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
Can go down here for right now

16
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
Everybody know that

17
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Are you in the live stream

18
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Whisper

19
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
Are doing this live stream from my Josh Allen Excel crashes else he's the one who's been doing the configuration subs

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,232
I'm also trying to sell him a virus from somebody at work but we're having trouble with that because

21
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
The song

22
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
All the computers are awful here

23
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,448
For some reason he has a house that is why

24
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
Bad for the vibe I don't understand how this works

25
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
He's got this area over here

26
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,736
Which is like a huge area which is great for the vibe

27
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,880
Channel 4 start

28
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Radio

29
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
What is

30
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Reflective

31
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
Or something

32
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Quiet

33
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
It's just

34
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
Snooze like Echoes and stuff of the violin

35
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,384
I have to figure that out and tribunals going on here

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,576
So right now his laptop there on the floor

37
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
And it's a sous laptop and right now trying to hack my tits in

38
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
How to get into alpha to the HTC vive

39
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,887
Because you want to take that and show them what options you get normal

40
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,055
I am only getting

41
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
Who options for

42
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
Resolution

43
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,295
Is either 641 for radio 720 by 14

44
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
Ignoring my bowes-lyon

45
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm not really sure why

46
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
And so I think it has to do something don't like

47
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
The max clock it is laptop not being able to us

48
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Can I see that I can't really

49
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
On

50
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,087
Brian are trying to figure out some way of hacking the

51
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
Do the right thing

52
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
5

53
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
TV

54
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
Can you go see that text clearly on online is bad arm

55
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Is this reasonable

56
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Ok

57
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
Can you read the text that is on the

58
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
The

59
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Turn off the lamp

60
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Ok

61
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
GoGo

62
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
Is 15 seconds is it

63
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,015
This is what in Eden set

64
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Early descriptor

65
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,263
This is just a needed descriptor right here

66
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,503
What I'm gonna do is that dangerous can affect arbitrarily changing a to come and was like

67
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Something

68
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
I'm using my new PC it's

69
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Sitting just out of you down there

70
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Are actually pretty if you want

71
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Camera down

72
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Towards the computer

73
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
You are not using they're not on the side there you go

74
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
New

75
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
Arm backup

76
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Sure

77
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
Seeded code

78
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Corals

79
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,031
I'm in so when you run this on the heater to give you these this information about the Egypt descriptors

80
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,127
This is information is normally stored inside of the HTC vive

81
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,199
But if you go into NVIDIA settings

82
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
You can then go for like the specific screen

83
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
Will be over what we doing is doing

84
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Arm

85
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,863
Alright now or actually trying to get the HTC vive to run on Josh's or laptop there

86
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
In my run on the vibe I mean

87
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Just output

88
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
Display like it all anything would be fine

89
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
It's very frustrating

90
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,991
Then you can do that on a divided self

91
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
We have that now

92
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
So I'm trying to get her to eat it in order to make

93
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
A mole

94
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
His computer is that would actually like

95
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Run

96
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
So

97
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
So I was started doing they started changing these numbers willy-nilly

98
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
Like in 1774

99
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
32

100
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
And save the file out

101
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
And then run this

102
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,583
Complaint about the wrong checksum but you can see the change the the clock

103
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Paris

104
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
Decode

105
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
You can see here I'll tell you somewhere

106
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Play for

107
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
The game for

108
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Something you did

109
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Maurice Keating

110
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Yeah

111
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
Yeah I don't know there is something will actually tell you what

112
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
What Hz screen refresh rate

113
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,439
If you are 128 MHz pixel clock

114
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
Noticing summary

115
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Actually asked them

116
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Would that be like it

117
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
You can't

118
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
So I guess I should have

119
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Somebody else's succinct summary of what's going on in the answer is right now I know but it's

120
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,487
Or is it a document that I should be riding somewhere or something I should write into a description

121
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
If you do that

122
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
We did it took awhile to find out

123
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
It turns out there is a tool called he did the code

124
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,639
That when you edit it will actually tell you with the checks on should be

125
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
So we've been kind of London you're having a dark until I found this one is like you should change your checksum 20s

126
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,743
So right now even trying couple of different modes so 128 MB I was like to lowest

127
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
Yeah that's right now

128
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Oops Clark 04

129
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Yes

130
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Play

131
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Ok so

132
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
The problem with Josh's laptop has is he can't

133
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
You can output to the Vibe

134
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
Because apparently has a Max pixel clock that is lower than 297 mHz

135
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,767
300

136
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
It's just your HDMI

137
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
I don't know why is laptop just don't want to do it

138
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
I'm trying to make it so his laptop will send jumped the Viber lower frequency that might be good enough

139
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
I could use my

140
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Tesco

141
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,479
Which is upstairs but Charles has stolen the man before

142
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
If anybody is near California Maryland and has a monitor we would really be appreciated right now

143
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,511
Don't have any way of making this work

144
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,167
Really good music common location and get them on her that way

145
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
What oh that's weird

146
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
I just did something

147
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Massively

148
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
120

149
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
Let's try to a foreign see what that does

150
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,823
De server checksum should be O2

151
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,895
CFA exam so checksums are valid

152
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,479
To do now is I'm going to give this to Josh

153
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
We need a hand dryer

154
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
Because I can't pull out from Gmail on Wi-Fi

155
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
Prime now I don't know it

156
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,351
Oh yeah I know this is this is not near Baltimore

157
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,959
Is an hour and a half away from V maybe 2-hours from Baltimore

158
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
USB drive

159
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Make sure

160
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Nothing

161
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
It needs to be formatted just for now

162
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,023
The other thing is really confusing to me is it says that an axe Dark lock on the

163
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
5 is 290 mHz

164
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
But it specifies Clark that are way above it

165
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Ok

166
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Console

167
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,479
Skip the max Clark is 297mm or sorry 290mm

168
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,063
But all the Motors best 54 297 then

169
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
How long the world does devised work at all

170
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Like I just

171
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
I don't get it

172
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,119
So I'm going to go coffee Charles II did that and I'm going to give it to Josh

173
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
How to get more

174
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Received you think that

175
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
Enough

176
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
So Josh is right now going to take this file

177
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Ok

178
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
I hope I'm online now

179
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Boxes

180
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
We had a bit of a rocky

181
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
Joshua's wiring is very confusing

182
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
And whoever confusion here in with panel lights which they got turned off

183
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Skip the computer and everything so that backup

184
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
Visible light 3 streamdale we had a power failure

185
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
What's the time

186
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,495
Charles

187
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
It was at Reed

188
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
Pause

189
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
Charles

190
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:20,031
Code

191
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:25,151
How's it going there is like atd tools in only one of them does white

192
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,319
204

193
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,671
Mum and the truth here

194
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,047
Screwed it

195
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,447
Play Castle

196
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
Reasonable

197
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
Is it

198
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
You can select me

199
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
52hz

200
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Ok

201
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,863
Laughing virus still very sad

202
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,775
Can you set it up to use the whatever is the resolution known as what

203
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
Play the itself looks like it's just us but we don't talk to it

204
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Enough

205
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Ireland 60hz

206
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
What's 90

207
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
5 Hz and see what happens I have forgotten which feel that was

208
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
Shut up

209
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Something is real

210
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
Play broken here open up the 51 and then

211
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
He has the wrong number of bikes so it's super super

212
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Don't worry about that was like

213
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
5-minutes take up 4 minutes

214
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Christine how much you don't care about protector tarot and everything

215
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Useful files

216
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
This is the wrong number of bytes

217
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
All the vibes needed for me again and copy it to the USB drive something is really wrong

218
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
Guitar

219
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,328
I might have had the wrong number fighting that anyway

220
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
About 20%

221
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
Connect to outlet

222
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
Yeah can you can you just pull the

223
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,704
What do you guys have a pulley and he did it

224
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,104
Over here you know what

225
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,320
Lights

226
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
Turn it down

227
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,696
Turn off my computer

228
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
Ok see you have it now I'm driving

229
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,312
Ok listen here

230
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,552
Take a look and see if that's filas

231
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,584
Or something

232
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,288
Please turn that down

233
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
No it had the right number of B I had this set the width wrong

234
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
There we go ok

235
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Everything's fine anyway

236
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:59,648
Save this into

237
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
Charles Eden

238
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
Place

239
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
Proprietary

240
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
So 250

241
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
MHz would be ok if the current one what is it it's

242
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
297 is 99 FPS

243
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
7 x 257

244
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
5.75

245
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
So we could do Carly do 75 and try that

246
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
I figure if it's not gonna work at 75 MHz it's probably looking for eggs

247
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Clean ID

248
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
Places like

249
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,744
Profiles does it I never heard of this

250
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,936
Inshot can you link even in chat

251
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,824
Maybe I'll be in a second

252
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
I know I don't have black eyes I just naturally have

253
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,768
Exactly why I don't sleep well

254
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
So in here

255
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,776
Say what is it right now 253

256
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
Set 63 is to 53 what did you say was the needed to

257
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
Ok 299

258
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
÷ 90 x 75 + 200

259
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Change July

260
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
Yeah we are worried that Josh's HDMI port could just be sad

261
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
What kind of like a jam ride

262
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
34th 320 I don't hear from her

263
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
The megahertz is by email

264
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:57,056
I'm just guessing 249 64 getting close

265
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
Is 24

266
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
Play 96 UK

267
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,720
02392

268
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,120
So maybe 58

269
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,288
249 to DA7

270
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
249 17

271
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:48,000
249 16 17 17 closest so then

272
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
Who is Maiden

273
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:56,448
Check song should.be 0 and that's despite right here

274
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,848
Ok

275
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:09,248
Connect to the work ok

276
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,344
This to the USB drive again

277
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,696
Give a text to Josh

278
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
Changing random by

279
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
Over trying to change I just can't experimentally found that these can you buy tripe

280
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:46,368
Those two b control the pixel clock which is

281
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
This number right here

282
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,352
And this number right here controls I'm guessing how fast that shifts the day to help the HDMI

283
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
I actually don't know that much about HDMI

284
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
Set alarm that part out but we have found the Josh's computer just absolutely

285
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
We'll light output to 297 MHz on the HTC vive

286
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:19,136
Has in its display modes which is a 90fps signal in so right now or

287
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:25,536
Mountain knock vlps down there were sending to in order to make it so he can

288
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,608
Output this computer so

289
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
If all goes well we might have the only HTC operated 75 mHz

290
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
B floor lino

291
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,944
HTC motivated turn display just won't work unless it exactly now yes so

292
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
This could all be a blast

293
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:52,160
What was the name of the rating on that time

294
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
9.1 70mhz

295
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
Which works out to 7 /

296
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,264
7 x 9075.5

297
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
Matthew on

298
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,664
25th

299
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,016
225 what we have done that before

300
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,904
Display my laptop can do 3:30

301
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,512
Wait a minute

302
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,912
Change the resolution of your display on laptop

303
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Yeah

304
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
This works I'm not to laugh so hard

305
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,016
What is the artist for sitting on

306
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
Turn it down

307
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,656
What is going on

308
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Play music

309
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
11

310
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,016
Rolling the dice

311
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,960
Looking at his DP it says get one is 165

312
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,848
Is an EFT 2

313
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:54,016
25mhz

314
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,088
3:30

315
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,928
Station of the HDMI port

316
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,024
YouTube am really curious to see if that changes their

317
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
So you said it was not 225

318
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Turn on

319
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,408
65%

320
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Volume five

321
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936

325
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
Yeah I guess

326
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
Programming mode

327
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
I'm guessing if I write to 2500 57

328
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
B47

329
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:38,208

Knows how to find out what the max pixel 4 keys on the HDMI output on Raspberry Pi

334
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,536
That would be super cool cos I would love to know if it even technically possible for a Raspberry Pi to help put

335
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,120
Add needed resolution

336
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
Good replace

337
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,664

That's should be one day

339
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,464
Check someone's one be valid ok so copy that over

340
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,768
Play Jack

341
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
Ok

Can I try this from us take the screen over and watching

346
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Ok chat

347
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,576
Why is not showing any signs of life so there's mediaburst

348
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
68 hours

349
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
We can go HDMI 48

350
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,800
1468

351
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,944

I just want to know that doesn't actually have this problem hand

353
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,536
Do you think your dad would have an extra monitor somewhere at home

354
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,984
RC chat so he says

355
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:36,896
150mm solo clothes

356
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,832
How do you help for 1080p 60 on a Raspberry Pi then

357
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768
Is it just pixels x

358
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,840
What's actually 225

359
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
MHz

360
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:21,696
No

361
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,632
What's 68 minutes on your computer

362
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,728

Bigger than 1920 pounds

366
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808

Well at least you guys are now calling my Hubsan dreams before I have to get them qual by Force

369
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:10,336
Does anyone else know if there is another Raspberry Pi like object that

370
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
That is that actually the right version

371
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:27,232
Josh I think this means that you're going to have to go back to me off

372
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,376
Pilot

373
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
Yeah it's just like it

374
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Render

375
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
Dim the screen

376
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,824
My laptop screen

377
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,760
Can look it up for the Raspberry Pi 3 to see if that's the same

378
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Baby really need

379
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
No newer versions do not use the same GPU

380
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
I will check this out

381
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,800
Search for people

382
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
Put it all down

383
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,096
Some fun taxi

384
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,240
4k

385
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,080
Interesting next

386
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,480
Sounds expensive

387
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,184
1280 or 1920 by 1200

388
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:08,096
What is the visor resolution again what should be like right on the cusp

389
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,056
2160 by 1200

390
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
Turn this off

391
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,912
Ok will look at all these pythons later

392
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Ok

393
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,431
The second fight with yourself

394
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
On Windows go back to broadcasting from my laptop and then

395
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
Wikitest whatever we wanted

396
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Someone said you are so can't use reduced blanking on device

397
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,399
Odroid C2

398
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,519
No I have the chat off now so I can see it

399
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,639
By the weekend that makes me very sad but I understand

400
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:31,295
We will look into I make a list of device

401
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,695
Is to look into a list do that right now

402
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:47,167
Wait what

403
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,543
Do the

404
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:37,343
Come on Jim up two Factor authentication

405
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
Am I I need a text

406
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,567
What about now

407
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Is there an echo now

408
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Resend code

409
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
Come on get up

410
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
Come to my phone

411
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Muesli

412
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
I'm not sure

413
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
Better

414
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,279
Values on the right audio device

415
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
I mean it should be fine can you text me because maybe that started through

416
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,663
I take my phone outside and text it

417
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,503
Google Authenticator what is Google Authenticator

418
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
1 time

419
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
A text

420
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:34,591
How short is that guy

421
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:46,367
This tab probably check

422
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,095
Tell the truth I can actually create the issue until

423
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,775
I was just commenting to Joshua earlier today that when we were young

424
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
Promoting College whenever we would have like something we wanted to do we just start working on the problem in here

425
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,575
Start coding and we would finish coding and we have like 9 hours of coding in a day and decree

426
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,623
As we got older like

427
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
Like getting started to get to the point where we can start coding kept getting pushed further and further back

428
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:32,191
Yes Josh so now we work for like 8 hours so we can code 41

429
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:37,311
Ok I got a code

430
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,135
And you guys gotta see the code

431
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,327
Is it what time is it

432
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Yes

433
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,471
Resend the code

434
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,407
Education background

435
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
Ok so for instance today in order to actually start working on this we have to go move

436
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,463
Air hockey table out from Josh's do you want to pick up the camera and point of this area had to move It air hockey table

437
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,583
Turn off Joshua's basement in order to get an area big enough to work with the five

438
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,983
The home via thing we're having a really big problem in this environment and we're getting reflections weekend

439
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
What from so we were sitting around 4 like until 2 a.m. last night like blankets covering up random things

440
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,783
Prove it

441
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
Go code things you just go like do the thing you wanted to do and

442
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,743
Like life is just

443
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:06,399
The fact you're getting older or it's Christine pointed out or maybe just a factor of

444
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
Do more complicated things

445
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
New issue request

446
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,599
Oh my gosh

447
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,399
I left my infrared camera at home

448
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:03,999
Wait what if you delete from now

449
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,399
That's fine I don't need any

450
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,199
What was I doing that's right

451
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,599
Life survive issue new issue identify

452
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
Minimal hardware that will be able to

453
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:42,399
Wasting time

454
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
If you guys on chat one-and-a-half any other

455
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
Translate you're pretty sure I can drive the Void let me know and I'll add them to this list or better yet go

456
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:20,799
Add to the ticket anything that you guys can find you guys don't mind and chat who were able to give

457
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
Play some of the information of the pixel Clarks and stuff like that you can add information to life survive ticket number 35

458
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:33,599
Are we going to do

459
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,999
I'm going to switch to my laptop leaving a code on your finger what are we doing

460
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,399
Yeah we didn't plan to be doing is coming up with a plan

461
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,663
What you would do with Farrell

462
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:04,063
Check the config file because

463
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
Camel Lights

464
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,839
Jason

465
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:22,495
Calibre can you put me into the UFC on five

466
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:28,895
Hey stop

467
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:35,295
Play also

468
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,695
Remove the star star star

469
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:46,815
Dad

470
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:55,775
Also bring up chat so it's kind of like down there

471
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:02,175
I'll pop down to chat

472
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:12,671
Think I don't really need to close it

473
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:18,559
Yeah I actually I want a mouse Now is very strange

474
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:26,495
92 Darcy ga

475
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:33,151
17

476
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
Oh yes that looks really clear for me

477
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:54,399
Put a chat one another

478
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,799
Actually be broadcasting the Chad

479
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
Play Kristoff

480
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
They looks great

481
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,671
Collecting that is fine so the one thing I really want

482
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
I wanted to try to bring Davids

483
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:28,959
Will my household things that I didn't try to find a white houses and then I want to go Paul

484
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,591
That data that can figure out where the object is based on the Lighthouse

485
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:40,991
On and then find it but there is a funny thing that happened when we were

486
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,391
I think was livestream 3 where Allen YouTube was like ok now thank you adopt someone Lighthouse

487
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
Between the two houses and then finally just now

488
00:53:54,047 --> 00:54:00,191
Not a good idea how many months to finally realise like oh the right

489
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,591
You just figure out the right pose from each lighthouse in the news that you resolved the position

490
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,407
You guys for ride the whole time

491
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:16,063
I'm hoping that she's that but something

492
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,463
Realise like the least there wasn't that much that was wasted on it

493
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,983
So how is your dumb

494
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,287
Ok so for you

495
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
I don't have the configuration file sizes

496
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,039
When is it

497
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:53,951
Programme

498
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:59,071
Turn the volume to do that

499
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
Question

500
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:14,431
It wasn't raining just because it was crashing so bad are you are you Googling that

501
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,271
You guys new the entire time that's the best way to do this was to find

502
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,671
Beyond the poses for Three Steps to each lighthouse and then figure out where you are relative to that rather than trial

503
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:29,791
Between the lighthouses

504
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,703
Now we still need to figure out the positions for lighthouses but the way would you actually solve the problem

505
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:43,103
Planning on

506
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,503
Even close it

507
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,903
Where did you put the stuff

508
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:02,303
Survive ex

509
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,703
I'm guessing you develop your tyre algorithm around the idea of having one and then you have to like oh my gosh cool now we can

510
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:15,103
Turn a better idea as to where everything is

511
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:21,503
32 are pretty sweet I'm still for

512
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:27,903
I stuck in Sealand because I'm Charles and I don't really like Arduino

513
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,303
Where does it

514
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:47,103
Call the make it

515
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,503
Sea

516
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,703
Survival

517
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:19,103
Survive where do I get the stuff out of context

518
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:25,503
Nctx

519
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:31,903
To the enemy

520
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:38,303
I think it actually wait until there's a problem with it running

521
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,703
First policy to actually be there

522
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:51,103
Turn on

523
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,503
It's inside that's ok

524
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:03,903
They've closed

525
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:10,303
Cube Bolton

526
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,191
Wonder

527
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:29,503
And then survived

528
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,183
Fantastic

529
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
How much to say

530
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:47,679
W e l l put a file

531
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,239
Ok that's a reasonable file

532
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,895
Thanks you are that's by can you write that into the configure she or the HTC

533
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,687
5 issue thing

534
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,367
250ml to steal too slow

535
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,327
297 is what we need to sort some point it was like

536
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,055
Old turn it on

537
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:31,455
Do you want to turn on the turn on and make sure there's at least right now make sure there's no point on the

538
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
In between houses

539
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,535
You're putting one on like

540
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,071
Turn off

541
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,935
It's still like getting a try moving what is that

542
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
Rotating rabbit

543
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,895
Is going to have a point today

544
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,295
Collecting the data

545
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:13,695
Is it going to change the way that works

546
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,279
It's just go away now

547
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,887
I've never read the book learning C The Hard Way I don't know

548
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,079
Fpga for a while

549
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:39,039
Why would you need nappy ga-fc and I'm being facetious fpga is a perfectly cromulent solution

550
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,855
Closer is the name of the configuration volume

551
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,351
I've never seen that something must be wrong

552
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,959
Houses

553
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,799
I don't understand I've never seen this

554
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,871
It says that is accurate to within

555
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:10,271
What's a micrometre

556
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,575
See it

557
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,175
Is it actually it is micro 10 - 6

558
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
No I haven't how

559
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,367
Mypos reclaims to the

560
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,207
Logie normally mypos or comes to like

561
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,255
3 mm

562
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,815
Bye

563
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:01,983
Continue layers for something

564
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:08,639
You have the last there's a really funny thing

565
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
Here this week I was working through

566
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:21,439
B&Q to check that

567
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
Ok so

568
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:29,375
The longest time over months now we've been trying to feel like it's just not right

569
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:35,775
So close but something's wrong and what's wrong we don't know it's never able to resolve that well

570
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:42,175
I could not figure out the life me why my lighthouse poser was just not

571
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:48,575
Because it should be just mind bogglingly good

572
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:54,975
Show you a commit

573
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Oh yes Iceland

574
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:04,191
There is in absolutely hilarious

575
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
Event that happened

576
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:12,127
It is

577
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,951
How do I actually know do I blame the file that works rate

578
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:32,095
What's the crazy thing was in Lynmouth dotsy

579
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,911
Surely there's a b in here

580
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:41,055
Play inland master.cf unction

581
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:46,175
And it was you guys are gonna laugh at me

582
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
Right here

583
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:54,367
What inverse magnitude so if this is used for is determining the inverse magnitude

584
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,767
Because you can calculate that and then you can x component lies by the particle contain Ian

585
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,607
Normalize the quaternions the problem was

586
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,423
That I wasn't taking the square root

587
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:14,079
So around everywhere else pays and somehow

588
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,151
Off this like kind of sort of work

589
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,943
Did actually like

590
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,343
I've never run I've never won the poser with this and it's perfect it's

591
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,743
Oh my gosh information I get with that do I get

592
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:38,143
Let's look at the never seen this before voice

593
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,287
Fossil cast

594
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:14,239
Expected to see

595
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,359
I don't know what's going on here

596
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:28,575
I really don't know what's going on here

597
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,415
What is this loaded the density map

598
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:38,815
I think this is wrong I think it's not accurate within 6 micrometres

599
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,679
I was so excited for a moment there

600
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,711
You know we can see you

601
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,151
You know what that means

602
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,503
Yeah ok inclusions

603
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:38,719
Data may be pointing tool

604
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:48,703
Tacular

605
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:56,127
So what's going on here is when you run it

606
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,967
Script outputs the the centre number

607
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,783
Which lighthouse in sweet number

608
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,183
Hideous and then gives you an angle in this

609
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,231
This is the angle

610
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:17,631
It tells you the angle from the angle from offset from centre of

611
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:23,007
The greatest show

612
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,015
Hypo in default does not really matter what type of guy

613
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Yeah

614
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:46,047
CEF no it doesn't matter

615
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:05,503
You Ltd

616
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:15,999
UL

617
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,839
Everything you need to do there

618
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
What would you do

619
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,775
I didn't think about asking that well

620
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,615
Also completely preoccupied with trying to get him

621
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:35,455
Arsenal I'm trying to worry about getting a monitor

622
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,039
Figure out what was going on with them

623
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,623
In general in this room yeah that was pretty bad

624
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
On

625
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:54,655
Something else what does it think the Lighthouse

626
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:00,031
No it didn't even write those information

627
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:06,431
I'm saying I've never seen it right who's information

628
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,831
See how that works

629
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,399
Here this runs all the code

630
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:54,047
I feel like I should probably print out the values of everything in then run it against the date again

631
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
The results are

632
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:03,007
Yes you're right I'm not actually writing up post here right now

633
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Alarm

634
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,895
Friend

635
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:15,295
Print0 variable print

636
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,903
Searching for very hard

637
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,727
Lighthouse Lighthouse 032

638
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
I'm Not Waving you internet

639
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:59,839
Wrong

640
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,167
Also the position for the live

641
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,639
Yeah

642
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
Don't move it out

643
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,015
Vehicle Street camera see what's going on

644
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:23,135
You're some I'm going to show them where all of the lighthouses are offended anymore

645
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:31,071
Is pointing forward 24-hours at my house up there

646
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,679
The Lighthouse

647
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,031
Please put the lighthouse on ceiling

648
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
Reflections off the wall

649
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,991
Ok

650
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:57,439
I don't know what I'm looking at it has a number that's really loud

651
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:10,239
Power to stop

652
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:20,223
Play

653
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:42,495
First one is just which is

654
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,615
How to basic food on how to cook

655
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:59,135
Did Kinder see the infrared but it wasn't like a really good infrared camera

656
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,975
Again the saying

657
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:06,303
That's definitely what we need northern soul was going on

658
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:12,191
Search really small

659
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,751
Guest p

660
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,919
I forgot how the messy

661
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:31,647
Fastest movie joke in college we needed to determine the pitch of something and

662
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
Stayed up really late

663
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
And

664
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,887
When we were done I had her when I was done it I had a piece of code that could tell the frequency of something

665
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
Open in Visual Basic

666
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,567
And it had online that down stopping down and it was pitch but we don't know how it works and somehow

667
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,335
Turn around

668
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,383
Peaks that were correct

669
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:02,367
Ok so us to target HMV points Whitehouse pass

670
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,975
Put the honour of the computer in the bottom of Thomas Barnardo

671
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
No

672
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,815
Go as the YouTube video on it

673
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,911
It's not for today

674
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,143
Anyway

675
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,703
To the Gang

676
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
Knights

677
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,383
Cast up to the wrong thing

678
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,703
Lighthouse quiet race you now

679
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,151
Why ask what is our current destination

680
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,583
Ok so what is cold here does is it takes a ratio

681
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:26,239
So here

682
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,335
This cold right here create a

683
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,127
Vector

684
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
Creating normalized vector

685
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:40,319
Are pretending that you are inside the White House in your shooting a rail at whatever angle

686
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:46,719
That was that actually shout out so it says that you were shooting at like 2 degrees this way in 5 degrees

687
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,999
On

688
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:54,399
A create a vector in 3D space is that then it rotates the Lighthouse or round whichever

689
01:16:55,423 --> 01:17:01,567
And then it off said by worker thinks the Lighthouse is and then it takes

690
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:07,967
Can you find the distance between that line and the point that it should be heading on the hmg and

691
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:14,367
Cross product without the distance between it's like a wine point difference

692
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:20,767
Racing point line distance line defined by Lighthouse parts

693
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:27,167
Fraction ratio and then it tells us quite off from that line it is

694
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:33,567
Bad wolf from r

695
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:38,175
Blind Justice

696
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,623
What is it say here it says a bunch of crazy stuff

697
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:53,023
One of the easiest software used for 3D

698
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,215
Cross price

699
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
3D

700
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:21,951
There is an ex right there

701
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:30,911
So cross product of us the target in the ratio down

702
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,279
Heater

703
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,095
Why

704
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,143
Remember why

705
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,983
223

706
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,591

Ice realise solide √ 6 micrometres

708
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,063
Which is like bigger

709
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
What's the square he taken out square root

710
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,791
A square

711
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:48,735
Pretty good 1.9 ml

712
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:59,743
What's the transfer of a volcano

713
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:06,143
What's going on

714
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:12,799
What was modified 3 minutes ago

715
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
Weird

716
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,968
20811 house

717
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:26,368
What's the answer that thing first

718
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,336
Hopefully this will work well

719
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,944
That's really good color

720
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,064
Actually yeah

7-years old

724
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,664
Sorry now I'm trying to figure out if my my pose

725
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:28,064
Which is a really slow post fight

726
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,928
9 and 10

727
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,488
Ok with this

728
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:41,632
Away it's the magnitude

Internal combustion

730
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:54,432
Take a look at this data now

731
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,888
What was the last time is worth

732
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,192
I don't know

733
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:24,128
I don't want to start going back and looking for version history

734
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:36,928
Yeah that's fine

735
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:43,328
Maybe I'm supposed to be

736
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:04,320

737
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:17,120
I also used to be normalizing that return in here

738
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:21,472
Probably do that

739
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:27,872
And a half sleep

740
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:42,464
You know what I've done

741
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,824
Where am I sitting that then

742
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,224
Actually

743
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,624
I know very well 1111 is SE14

744
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:16,512
Union 1000

745
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:23,168
30-seconds

746
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:29,568
1 to 12

747
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:35,968
.5

748
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:42,368
And the other one was 9

749
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:48,768
B a b y in 99

750
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:55,168
5 x 12 / 39

751
01:24:55,424 --> 01:25:00,544
Sunday security

752
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,664
Oh my gosh

753
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,456
Oh my gosh

754
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:15,392
That's not the identity that's just a random one sound effect any

755
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:21,792
Anyway I still want

756
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:27,936
Stata normalise thank you

757
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:48,160
Yeah we did in mercury to also had that bothered by the way

758
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:54,560
The bird riding have the magnitude figured out right or whatever

759
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,960
That's why I don't want that

760
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:07,360
The Night game engine rawangi

761
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:13,760
5 years there is a bug in a library file

762
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:20,160
A very very long time

763
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:25,024
Quiet sounds like a fruit

764
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
Put these somewhere else Mr screen to get some how to do it

765
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,184
We actually don't use matrices here right now or using onions

766
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:31,584
Easier to do math with even though matrices are faster when you get

767
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,984
Like if you have a matrix need to rotate .5 that's fast and you need to rotate

768
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,312
You're right I do need a kumquat

769
01:27:54,112 --> 01:28:00,256
It does need to be square

770
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:22,016
I'm thinking that those changes to the quaternium library and cause liver problems

771
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:29,440
Play the changes correct

772
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:35,840
Euro to zloty

773
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:42,240
Turn off Reedus

774
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,944
That's what I do if I take an arbitrary or oil there

775
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:57,344
And I generally from the boiler rotation and I convert that to a matrix and

776
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,744
Generated from The Matrix and I converted into an oil vector and then I create a

777
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:10,144
And I rotate that point by the quaternium factor than by the way it's really neat and

778
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,544
Put around the first point and then I rotate that back by that

779
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,944
Italian the radiators so I'm thinking of operations in between

780
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,248
Hopefully pretty good

781
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:32,416
Arm maybe something on Spotify

782
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:38,816
What is the

783
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,120
Us

784
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,448
Plastic surgery

785
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:56,736
Yeah that looks more like it ok my thing may be bad but

786
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:03,136
The results are

787
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:09,536
Supposed to be 3.69

788
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:20,032
Search

789
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,104
Hey Ben just wondering

790
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,504
How close should we be able to tell her the how far is the lighthouses are they really are

791
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:42,304
Exactly

792
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:48,704
All of this is going to get turned into a poser

793
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:55,104
Posing system

794
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:01,504
No I actually wanted to do but then Jackson pointed out

795
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,904
And I had written 1111

796
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:14,304
And the problem is that 1111 Catania is not valid

797
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:20,704
Measure how far are you from

798
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:27,104
You really are you can measure how far your solution is from minimising Solaris

799
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:33,504
No I can measure how far is the White House is from

800
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:39,904
Bedroom light the distance between the Lighthouse

801
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,304
The actual distances of 2.92 m and 3.6 m

802
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,704
Anyway

803
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:59,104
Elytra diastolic on this is not a valid

804
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:05,504
I'm in that doesn't do any read rotation is a 100

805
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,904
Onion where I get Steven a0001 cottonian or

806
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,104
That could be above library to

807
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
What is msdn

808
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:43,904
Alarm definition

809
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,536
The same order

810
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,376
Ok Google

811
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:58,496
Because if we was 0 it doesn't matter if you have like an episode 1

812
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,288
I think all the matters is

813
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,872
Yeah I think

814
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:13,856
But if if we is 0 then you have an identity Catania no matter what is well

815
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Right

816
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:20,256
So like sorry TW10

817
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,120
Can't make any rotation motion

818
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:32,544
X5uw email manage Microsoft

819
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:40,224
I don't believe you I'm going to test

820
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:46,624
What's create a new guitar

821
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:53,024
Not that I have any reason not to believe you

822
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,096
0001

823
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,216
I just learn something new

824
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:19,808
Is your party victory handle input

825
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,672
Not sure

826
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,024
00013

827
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:36,960
Don't you mean like I can say

11

829
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,576
Onions is that what I thought it was

830
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,464
Plants of the new everyday

831
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:04,096
Can you repeat the same as the input

832
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:11,264
Why

833
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:25,856
Play Rotate the doctor is it actually copies it anyway so the input can be the same as

834
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:38,656
Back to work work work

835
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,520
On your phone

836
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:50,176
Oh my god people are riding they're all over the place

837
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,736
3:00

838
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,064
Yeah he need like 297 mHz

839
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,648
Turn guys

840
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:03,744
When is got to make a board that can do this

841
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:13,728
Ben I definitely think that that is the same way a lot of people on the Wikipedia page for

842
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
Think about it

843
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,592
That is all kind of messed up

844
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:23,456
That's the probability cloud from where the other lighthouse could be

845
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:29,856
Which lighthouse is there my house number 11

846
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:33,696
No

847
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:40,352
As one that would be

848
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,912
It's the one that says see

849
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:57,248
Do you want to come out just to see if it actually is it

850
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,784
A really good point

851
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,368
That's really close to one of the lighthouses

852
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,768
Close to that one

853
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:30,016
Oh hey David David Chapman came up with a

854
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:34,368
Play good so I want to get my working for the calibrate

855
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:40,768
David Chapman came up with a poser that can compose a system even though it's not perfect but

856
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:47,168
Composed in about 1.6 microseconds that's micro

857
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,448
Little you

858
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,984
Night light

859
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:54,592
Little us are so I really want to try to get that in today

860
01:38:56,128 --> 01:39:02,272
David art by Dr David Chapman sorry

861
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:12,768
There's so much stuff is going on in the technology is getting so head of Us right now and we don't even have a second monitor so Josh is

862
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,560
Free of charge can do

863
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
I don't

864
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,168
I don't want

865
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:25,568
Benner saying a lot of very interesting things

866
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
I want

01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,408
Live chat

868
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:35,808
No the live chats are not saved

869
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:47,840
Encourage people to read the things that then it's saying

870
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:55,008
It is

871
01:39:55,776 --> 01:40:00,384
That's White House wine

872
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,712
Take a look and see what the date is coming off Inverness

873
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:14,464

My effective wallpaper problem

875
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,168
I'm yo we need to do

876
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:32,128
Somebody else is on their setup

877
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:36,224
Turn off Darren in livestream have access to a on

878
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,624
Have access to a set up with a by and white survive so you can just runs against it

879
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,160
You're getting this really weird data

880
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,952
Don't be really

881
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,488
Really nice and helpful

882
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,768
On

883
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:53,120
If you guys can just anybody else can run this

884
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,520
Really appreciate it

885
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,848
Another 5 hours just in case

886
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:09,504
Actually interesting thing Josh is going to be buying this in once we find something disastrously wrong with it I've already

887
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,136
Play Mike order for a second vaidisova Josh so

888
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:21,536

Blue lights on

892
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:42,528
Ok so first thing's first but we actually have to do

893
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:48,416
What is the actually have to convert Dave's code

894
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:54,048
Do not disturb my code into a opposer

895
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:56,096
Set

896
01:41:56,352 --> 01:42:02,496
Poser

897
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:08,896
I'm not going to say anything

898
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:15,296
Play I'm you on I cannot accept anything from the wife but I will accept full scene data

899
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:21,696
I can go hopefully copy and paste this pretty much Hulse

900
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,264
Upstairs

901
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:55,232
Trash is there seriously nobody you can text to get another wrong again

902
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:01,632
Is there a best buy nearby

903
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:08,032
Bestbuy.com

904
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:14,432
What's a see how much monitor is we might just go by Martin

905
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,248
Video

906
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:23,648
I love meatballs but you have to make sure the sauce doesn't have

907
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:33,888
And make sure the Vinegar like the meatballs are you making yourself it's fine if you get them made

908
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:41,312
Yeah no beginning

909
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:43,872
A cheapest possible monitor

910
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:50,272
We just need something for Josh to use acres

I think so

1050
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:51,584
The big thing is the angle has to be

1051
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,376
Play the same

1052
02:04:56,192 --> 02:05:00,288

1061
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:37,824
Play

1062
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,440

02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:11,616
I don't know what causes the distribution might

1066
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:14,944
Alright

1067
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:46,432
4 cm in 5 cm into polyfine

1068
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,464
Ok that's not that bad

1069
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:10,240
That's pretty terrible that's very terrible

1070
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:16,896
Is that one of yours

1071
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:21,248

What's 0

1073
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:30,720
How much you have a database

1074
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,792
Can you shrink your window significantly

1075
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:39,424

1076
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,616
Song

1077
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:58,624

214 180

1080
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:11,680
I just paid my matches though it's interesting that they

Yeah

1083
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
Now

1084
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:01,344
It's concerning

1085
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:05,440
It's ok

1086
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:30,784
Opera restriction make it like 200 and 250

1087
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:44,864
That's really wrong to 15200 sorry

1088
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:56,384
That's just absolutely wrong because the angle and that will have to be pretty Ste

1089
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,944
Very shallow

1090
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,512

02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:23,072
That's one of the lighthouses from this point of view

1105
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:29,472
Grande thing with the other Lighthouse

1106
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:42,016
The problem is my broadcast to hold desktop and the screen resolution is much higher

1107
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:49,184
So it it makes it hard and it also uses up more bandwidth so

1108
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:55,584
Make my defined solve into my Galaxy

1109
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,376
Lara points visible

1110
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:00,960
That was even

1111
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:06,848
Search lighthouse €2 that would BBB would be the one of the time visible according to this

1112
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:10,944
C a one says boy

1113
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:26,560
Play houses

1114
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:32,960
That is rough

1115
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:40,384
I can do

1116
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:46,272
Play Rangers

1117
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,816
Equine

1118
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,352
Visible

1119
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:10,080
I'm getting really close to just dumping my mine altogether because if his thing comes up with the better

1120
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:12,640
The mind then it's just pointless

1121
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:16,480
Minimum

1122
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:23,392
Reasonable

1123
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:29,792
A headset headset so what we actually see here is the

1124
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:33,376
Expected anchor sorry the bluedot

1125
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:39,776
The actual positions be received by the by the headset from Royal lighthouse thanks all the end

1126
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,848
Star and

1127
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:49,760
Irish Rotary the red dots or where David

1128
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:55,392
The rhythm thinks they should be based on his matrix for what he thinks is the

1129
02:15:57,184 --> 02:16:03,328
Update the whatever is of the White House the White House

1130
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:10,752
Sing pickups fearful David Chapman do you want to

1131
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:13,568
Turn the battery

1132
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:37,888
Play me a number song

1133
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:41,728
Tell me everybody

1134
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:47,104
I'll let you know

1135
02:16:57,856 --> 02:17:00,672
Click the phone button

1136
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:05,024
That would you can get your fine so

1137
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,656
Add David Chapman where is

1138
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:22,432
3.1 m and

1139
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,040
Lighthouse sea

1140
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:31,648
Is 3.58 a real life

1141
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:36,768
Hey David Cameron you care if we call you in then you can talk live

1142
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:40,864
Actually we could Jack him into the computer

1143
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,424
The headphone jack

1144
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:46,496
You have a headphone jack year

1145
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:53,664
45 cable

1146
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:59,296
Measure of the

1147
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:10,048
Where's the tape measure

1148
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:26,432
Do you have a measure

1149
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:28,736
Couch

1150
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,704
Putting on the couch esino tape measure

1151
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:27,360
Christine 3-year she just

1152
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:40,672
Quiet

1153
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:47,840
Spell

1154
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:54,240
Go away

1155
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:56,544
11

1156
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:00,384
10 inches

1157
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,224
1 years

1158
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:14,720
10-piece

1159
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:29,056
Is

1160
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:38,016
Set 3.59 close to 3.64

1161
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:44,416
And

1162
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:47,488
15

1163
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,560
David Chapman just friend

1164
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:55,168
Say David Chapman can we call you

1165
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,984
So he says

1166
02:20:58,752 --> 02:21:02,336
Harsh or I think he said sure

1167
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:04,384
Ok

1168
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:12,832
You said ok ok will call you right now

1169
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:15,136
I'm going to

1170
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:19,744
I'm going to see if I can call you in my phone

1171
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,912
Still there

1172
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:36,128
Hold on I'm going to just make him I have two audio sources

1173
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:38,944
Give me a second Dave

1174
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:49,696
What no what

1175
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:56,608
I don't even have

1176
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:09,408
How have audio

1177
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:21,696
Carolina volume

1178
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:25,280
Play gm20 for a girl

1179
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,840
HDMI

1180
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:43,200
That's really going to sound

1181
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:46,272
Jimmy USB audio

1182
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:47,040
Finglas

1183
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:55,232
How to use that sorry Dave hold on

1184
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:08,288
Oh yeah we never rains code against the other one

1185
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:14,688
Switch off by 3 cm and off

1186
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:21,088
That's pretty good for a z in fact I would say that is within our measurement error so

1187
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:27,488
I'm going to do right now is completely abandoned trying to port my code over to this and

1188
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:31,840
Story about 14-days code in for right now we'll just call a good enough

1189
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:36,448
Is there as level

1190
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:39,264
Yes my name is label

1191
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:44,640
I need a place I can

1192
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:55,392
Drivers

1193
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:03,584
Identified it

1194
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:18,432
There's a lot of value that might be so sad

1195
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:24,832
Idea secondary device

1196
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:26,880
Play say something

1197
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,928
Play speak in Birmingham

1198
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:32,512
So Dave I have no way of hearing you

1199
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:38,912
Whatever you say your wife

1200
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:41,216
In the night don't know what you're saying

1201
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:47,616
Oh really I haven't said anything yet and anybody hear me

1202
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:49,408
On

1203
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,016
Ok

1204
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,552
I think you might be good now

1205
02:24:56,576 --> 02:25:02,720
Anyone yummy

1206
02:25:02,976 --> 02:25:03,488
Dave

1207
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:10,144
C3 get the sky

1208
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:18,592
Yeah I can hear myself on the shelf ok so

1209
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:22,176
Ok this is better

1210
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,136
Chelsea

1211
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:33,440
This

1212
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:34,720
Here

1213
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:38,048
David can you say some

1214
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,984
Sounds really hard to hear

1215
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:01,088
No David David you're going in and out hold on

1216
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,648
Hold on David

1217
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,232
I know he can serious

1218
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,024
Beyond Skyrim

1219
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:17,984
Ok you're really

1220
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,776
It's really watery David

1221
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:25,152
Ok you can turn off your microphone I can't turn you down

1222
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:30,016
David

1223
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:31,040
Ok

1224
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:31,808
Ok

1225
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:33,344
Ok almost perfect

1226
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:40,256
The code that I wrote it

1227
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:46,656
Assumes an orthographic projection or an axonometric projection

1228
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:49,472
Stool for a poo

1229
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:55,616
So it would be really cool if you brought up my Wikipedia page that talks about the X Factor

1230
02:26:56,128 --> 02:27:00,480
Really funny pictures of some paintings that you can make a nose

1231
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:05,088
Apology the basically I am assuming that

1232
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:08,416
The screen space

1233
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:10,976
Point the point that you see

1234
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:13,536
Inner corner system of the Lighthouse

1235
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:20,192
But those points are some non-linear functions of the points that you have

1236
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:21,472
The offset

1237
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:23,264
Overhead mountain

1238
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:25,568
I've had the headlines today

1239
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,640
From the device

1240
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:35,552
But then it is clearly just the approximation and the reason for that is because it's really hard

1241
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:38,880
Tell the difference between one and address is getting smaller because

1242
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:46,560
Verses when it's getting smaller because you're moving it on for the returner away

1243
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:49,888
The idea that moving an object further away from the camera

1244
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:52,704
Looks a lot like making it smaller

1245
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:59,104
Mean that we don't really have to tell the difference

1246
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:01,408
That

1247
02:28:01,664 --> 02:28:07,808
When you get smaller because it's too early which isn't reasonable but just make sure it's ok

1248
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:08,832
Girl by the sea

1249
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:13,952
So then how far away from the camera does it have to be

1250
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:15,488
Any chance

1251
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,768
That

1252
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:18,304
If you want to figure out

1253
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,840
What the poses

1254
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:26,496
Allowed to change in the paper what you do if you drop

1255
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:29,312
Hold on a second pull up some of the stuff

1256
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:35,456
I found a while back a picture on animated gif on YouTube

1257
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:38,016
After that I think really help

1258
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:40,576
What's the picture of the house do you remember where that is

1259
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:49,024
I have remembered that there was something on and Wikipedia and I forget which Wikipedia page was one that

1260
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,304
The difference between

1261
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:54,912
A projection where you divide by the equal linear projection

1262
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:56,448
And some of these

1263
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,008
Axonometric projection

1264
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:08,480
Ok you've had it is the picture of the house were they

1265
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:11,040
Be kind of show with the two different extremes

1266
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:15,392
Yeah so that picture that you see

1267
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:17,184
Dictionary

1268
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:19,744
That you see as the house

1269
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,280
Really

1270
02:29:22,304 --> 02:29:24,096
It shows that there is some dick

1271
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:26,144
Particularly when it's really close

1272
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:30,752
The further away you move from the camera left at different

1273
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:35,872
And even though there is some different it can still pick you up about patient more or less

1274
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:38,688
Even if your sumalatha graphics

1275
02:29:38,944 --> 02:29:39,712
Project

1276
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:41,760
Terrible

1277
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:43,040
But it's basically

1278
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:45,600
The approximation is basically where you

1279
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:47,648
I have a 2D sheet of paper

1280
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:53,280
I'm going to try to realise that aren't orthogonal I'm going to call 1X 1y and onesie

1281
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:55,840
And then I'm going to say ok that's what it is

1282
02:29:56,096 --> 02:29:58,912
Ok now move it back in 3D space and figure out

1283
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:01,984
How far away I have to be for that too

1284
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:07,104
That's basically what it does and it's really really really fast

1285
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:10,688
So if it's good enough

1286
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,808
If nothing else it could be

1287
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,624
A starting point for an initial guess

1288
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,160
Iterative

1289
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:25,024
A very good initial guess but it might be good enough so

1290
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,840
I will what will you need help

1291
02:30:28,096 --> 02:30:31,936
I think there were a couple of cases were the best

1292
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:35,264
Disability team Aprilia Walsall

1293
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:38,080
How good is

1294
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:40,384
Yeah that's what it go

1295
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:44,480
So I guess my summary on this would be

1296
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:47,296
Generally taken from

1297
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:48,576
Is

1298
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:52,416
If a point is closer to the camera

1299
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:57,024
A small amount of emotion with cause in large emotion

1300
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,584
From the perspective of the camera

1301
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:02,144
And I use lighthouse in camarillo

1302
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:03,680
Like mixed

1303
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:07,776
Yeah sorry

1304
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:12,896
That makes sense when you get closer and closer to the camera

1305
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:16,224
Looks like I'm large and motion to the camera

1306
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:22,368
What happens is different points and the head-mounted the head man is like right next to the Lighthouse

1307
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:28,000
Pretty much the worst case

1308
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:32,608
The Z co-ordinate for the best for some of the points on the head map display

1309
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:35,680
Are different than the Z coordinates for the other one

1310
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:40,544
Assume that was lead position for all of them is pretty close together

1311
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:46,432
We're it doesn't make very much if the difference in terms of the perspective divide

1312
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:48,480
Then it should be alright

1313
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:55,648
Sorry just clarify when he says

1314
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:02,304
What is actually talking about in this case is the disease from the perspective of the camera with z

1315
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:03,840
Out of the screen

1316
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:05,120
So

1317
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:06,656
If you have a home match

1318
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:09,472
Here

1319
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:12,032
If you have gone from your point of view

1320
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:14,080
Some point very close up here

1321
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,128
Like this

1322
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:19,712
And some point like that so very close and very far

1323
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:22,272
In this approximation works out very poorly

1324
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:26,624
If most points show up in kind of the same plane

1325
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:27,648
Then

1326
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:29,952
The approximation Works much better

1327
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:35,072
And that's because the difference between things being closing fire and how that size change

1328
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:37,376
Really kind of

1329
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:40,448
Doesn't matter if there points are kind of all McFly

1330
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:43,008
Are you saying all the same Z points

1331
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:43,776
You saying

1332
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:45,312
The distance from the can

1333
02:32:49,408 --> 02:32:52,992
Yeah I think that's really good if there any other questions about

1334
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:59,904
We pretty much take a picture then you know it's a 3D dry

1335
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:01,952
Etihad A380 painting

1336
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:06,304
And but you have it drawn on a 2D page

1337
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:10,912
Then you you take the you drop down there that's the origin

1338
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:13,728
And then you draw line and say that

1339
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:20,384
This is the right direction and this is the forward Direction and you dropped me line you say that

1340
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:21,664
That's what it is

1341
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:23,968
Well we know that there's no way

1342
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:25,760
Three Lines

1343
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:26,784
Intu Derby

1344
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:30,112
That actually map to the three lines and comedian

1345
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:32,416
But we're going to do it anyway

1346
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:35,232
And it's actually not too bad

1347
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:38,560
And the funny thing about this project

1348
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:41,632
It said it's been around for about 400 years

1349
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:44,192
In the artist red original

1350
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:45,728
Originated in China

1351
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,520
I'm still

1352
02:33:47,776 --> 02:33:51,360
McCann I guess say that is the cheap Chinese way of doing it

1353
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:56,224
And that's it a little bit

1354
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:59,296
Making a joke everybody finds

1355
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:00,832
Aberdare

1356
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:02,624
Yeah it is

1357
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:06,976
Is the originated in China about 100 years years ago

1358
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:09,280
End

1359
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:12,096
Is there a really interesting paintings

1360
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:14,656
With some impossible drawings

1361
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:18,496
Drawing where you have a staircase that leads around on its

1362
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,544
I am repeating

1363
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:25,664
There are some really interesting corner cases

1364
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,200
Where does projection

1365
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:30,016
I can do something to don't make any sense

1366
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:33,856
What's mean about an architectural drawing

1367
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:35,392
And it

1368
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:38,208
Good enough that if you draw something in that projection

1369
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:44,352
You better a person looking at a picture to look at it and say ok I can see what this is

1370
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:49,216
I thought not bad but you know I think for the

1371
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:50,752
Make the invoice Prague

1372
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:53,568
Figuring out what the object is giving the teacher

1373
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,592
Elijah

1374
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:56,640
Are they trying to stop The Fall

1375
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:00,224
Play together

1376
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:01,760
The approach

1377
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:05,856
If it's good enough I'm hoping

1378
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:07,904
If I do

1379
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:09,440
Application

1380
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:10,720
What are the stars

1381
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:14,048
That weekend try to Italy

1382
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:16,096
Come up with an even better

1383
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:19,168
I think that

1384
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:20,448
That could potentially

1385
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:25,824
I'll be very good approaches we have a really good initial guess Lynn there are

1386
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:26,848
Message

1387
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,640
The try to

1388
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:31,200
Atomising function

1389
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:32,736
Ok

1390
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:36,576
I tried writing that but some told that after miserly or function

1391
02:35:38,112 --> 02:35:42,464
But I wasn't using Lagrange multipliers

1392
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,256
And I was starting from

1393
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:45,792
The identity

1394
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:52,192
Doctor so I didn't have an initial guess and it's ok really what is 2 million iteration

1395
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:57,568
So hopefully it will start with an angel it's really close today

1396
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:01,152
Van Damme

1397
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,784
The next step

1398
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,064
From this

1399
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:10,880
Start using the starting point

1400
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:12,672
And then we're fine

1401
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,208
Yes

1402
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:18,304
And just to clarify I don't know if you saw the results Dave

1403
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:24,704
On but I can period so these points that are on the screen that I have operate now the blue points are the

1404
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,240
Absolute

1405
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,520
The red RV

1406
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
Arm

1407
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:30,592
If we use his gas

1408
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:33,408
No we need A299

1409
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,688
6

1410
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:38,528
If we start with his point as a gas

1411
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:40,320
This is just

1412
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:46,720
And then we create a quaternions and position rotation so pose out of his

1413
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:47,488
Calculator

1414
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,024
Then

1415
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:50,816
This is the results we get

1416
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:52,096
Batteries

1417
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:59,520
So right now I think what I want to do especially considering he get on much better answer for the disk

1418
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:00,800
Lighthouse tonight

1419
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:04,384
I think that you really want

1420
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,664
Completely dish

1421
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,712
The Charles

1422
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,992
White House

1423
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:11,296
I think for the rest of time here

1424
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:14,624
I think I'm going to focus I'm trying to get Dave's code

1425
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:18,208
Into a pose finding situation with life survive

1426
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:20,768
In order to use it in the rest of the cyst

1427
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:24,096
Fingers crossed everything goes well today

1428
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:27,168
We might actually get your ID your stuff in in test

1429
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,984
Sound good

1430
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:32,800
Sound good

1431
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:35,104
Sounds good

1432
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:38,176
Ok I'll keep working Emerald ranch multipliers

1433
02:37:39,456 --> 02:37:41,760
The I'm sure it'll be good to have it is

1434
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,040
Salou

1435
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:49,440
Rocky boxing and then but I can finish them

1436
02:37:49,696 --> 02:37:52,256
How many seconds are in

1437
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:53,024
Yeah

1438
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,328
Annoying

1439
02:37:55,584 --> 02:38:00,704
Ok well thanks I guess we'll get moving around here

1440
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:04,288
Taxi

1441
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:34,240
Wake me up at 5-minutes

1442
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:40,640
Oh yeah you're right there will be an echo

1443
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:43,712
Ok that's all

1444
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:23,296
A good view

1445
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,392
Sure is a fine view

1446
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:43,776
People do we have right now in stream

1447
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:45,312
71

1448
02:40:50,176 --> 02:40:51,200
Fig

1449
02:40:55,296 --> 02:40:56,320
Here

1450
02:40:56,832 --> 02:41:01,952
So everyone time for us to just ditch my thing on the floor in Friday implement

1451
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:03,744
You're using Dave's code

1452
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:47,424
Silver going to be

1453
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:53,568
I think you can do if you are

1454
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:55,104
Is trying to figure out

1455
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,992
I want to find a way of

1456
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:02,016
Looking at the code

1457
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:03,040
Is coming out

1458
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:08,160
Distance

1459
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:15,840
Alexa

1460
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:18,912
I don't know why

1461
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:25,056
I think so

1462
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,128
Turn it down

1463
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,688
209

1464
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,736
296

1465
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:35,808
Is

1466
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:44,256
You like I am us twisted the resolution divide was a little bit lower

1467
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,272
Quiet

1468

1472
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,407

02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:25,023

1474
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:26,303

1475
02:46:36,287 --> 02:46:36,799

1476
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:41,919
Turn it up so that

1477
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:45,503
Hello hello

1478
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:49,087
Early morning me

1479
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:07,775
Survive underscore

1480
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:17,759
EDC la pack

1481
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:24,159
Dcl lecac in the league

1482
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:24,927
Folder

1483
02:47:47,967 --> 02:47:54,111
So Dave Road is only your mouth library that's what Sheila Packers

1484
02:47:54,623 --> 02:48:00,767
Thomas based off of the idea of normal apocalypse by you know

1485
02:49:25,247 --> 02:49:31,391
Flashes of White

1486
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:32,927
Yeah

1487
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:39,327
Off main Screwfix

1488
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:56,223
So I'll talk about what's on your screen right now for a second

1489
02:50:06,207 --> 02:50:08,255
Can you move your window all the way to the left

1490
02:50:08,511 --> 02:50:11,071
To move your

1491
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:12,863
You're saying it's stuck

1492
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:16,447
Overlapped

1493
02:50:19,007 --> 02:50:23,871
Ok so the box formation it's making that's fine

1494
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:29,503
The problem is when we have lights they're like all the way up to one side or the other

1495
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:32,063
Like if you can leave the window bigger sale

1496
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:34,367
Step

1497
02:50:35,135 --> 02:50:36,671
What just happened

1498
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:39,999
No that formation is ok

1499
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:43,839
What when you have point satellite office

1500
02:50:57,663 --> 02:51:03,807
That's probably fair

1501
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:10,207
Happens were the other Lighthouse

1502
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:22,239
Yeah I know it just jumped

1503
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:31,711
What is going on there

1504
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:51,679
I don't know why

1505
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:58,079
I look for both

1506
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:04,479
All the thing everything that I have a light bulb what does this mean

1507
02:52:04,735 --> 02:52:10,879

1508
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:17,279
What's good to me really good to me

1509
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:25,215

02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:31,615
Area of terrible

1511
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:44,415
When using the voice that something other than 90 MB refresh rate in it just would not

1512
02:52:44,671 --> 02:52:50,815

02:52:59,519 --> 02:53:05,663

1523
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:36,543
Oh my God what's going on

02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:45,247
It's freaking out

1525
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:56,255
Now it's fine now

1526
02:54:56,511 --> 02:55:02,655
Can you move along the back as I can see it very

1527
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:08,543

1529
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:48,991
Freaking out

1530
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:55,391
What is going on

1531
02:55:55,647 --> 02:56:01,791
Now

1532
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:08,191
Stanley freaking out

1533
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:14,847
Yo what is what

1534
02:56:15,103 --> 02:56:21,247
Ok it's definitely consistently broken

1535
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:27,647
Did you see it to produce like a diagonal line

1536
02:56:27,903 --> 02:56:30,719
I wish I was wrong with this

1537
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:49,151
At least consistent

1538
02:56:49,663 --> 02:56:55,807
Turn off

1539
02:56:56,063 --> 02:57:02,207
Do you mind working

1540
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:08,607
Did she eat food my work

1541
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:24,895
We have tried playing real live games and it's totally does Twitch app

1542
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:50,495
Music

1543
02:58:57,151 --> 02:59:00,479
Reminders

1544
02:59:00,991 --> 02:59:07,135
Turn on

1545
02:59:13,791 --> 02:59:15,839
On your computer

1546
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:21,215
Sure but I can't because I can't really do much right now

1547
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:07,807
Add

1548
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:09,087
JJ

1549
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:15,487
Yeah I said that we had tried playing it still liked witching hour

1550
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:32,895
What's waking I think that means like trying to run it a lower res

1551
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:34,943
Iran

1552
03:00:35,711 --> 03:00:41,855
Oh no it's blanking so what it is is there is like a garden area around the actual

1553
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:50,047
Like this like that the actual screen size is bigger than the visible screen size

1554
03:00:50,559 --> 03:00:54,911
And reduced blanking I think is when you take that and you start pulling that down

1555
03:00:55,167 --> 03:01:00,799
So that like you just have left texels that are being sent that are 10 in the blanking periods

1556
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:07,967
The blanking period as when like is when there is no data currently no visible data currently being sent

1557
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:49,439
Figure something out if I have a font size smaller

1558
03:01:51,999 --> 03:01:54,815
12

1559
03:01:55,071 --> 03:01:57,631
Why was there be a sensory name

1560
03:01:58,143 --> 03:01:59,679
55 to feet

1561
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:06,335
4:35 55 is

1562
03:02:06,591 --> 03:02:07,103
Ok

1563
03:02:07,615 --> 03:02:13,247
I don't know why they chose to do this with the five but for some reason when they sent data

1564
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:16,063
Can send flights

1565
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:19,391
That's not actually populated with real data

1566
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:25,023
As far as I can gather when you get a tooth teeth ITV 5 and there's nothing there

1567
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:27,839
Play this is non dealer

1568
03:02:29,887 --> 03:02:31,167
Play spring it up

1569
03:02:31,423 --> 03:02:31,935
Yeah

1570
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:33,471
Turn it up

1571
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:47,551
I don't think so the reason I think it's because normally that time staying

1572
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:51,135
Matches that of a previous packet

1573
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:54,975
So it looks like you're using the same buffer to keep sending the data

1574
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:56,511
But then the alarm

1575
03:02:56,767 --> 03:03:00,863
Putting the like say Hey by the way this actually isn't a valid packet

1576
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:34,655
Hey Dr Chapman I don't know if you still listening but you really should be taking on the

1577
03:03:36,191 --> 03:03:37,471
The normals

1578
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:39,775
That's really important

1579
03:03:40,031 --> 03:03:46,175
The normals will let you quickly weed out any complete nonsense

1580
03:05:27,295 --> 03:05:30,623
Suspicious what about

1581
03:05:31,135 --> 03:05:32,927

03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:03,551

Compiled

1658
03:18:37,567 --> 03:18:41,407
So you think you have valid data that's coming in that radically out of order

1659
03:18:41,919 --> 03:18:48,063
Play open up your screen again

1660
03:18:52,671 --> 03:18:58,815
Turn on the lights

They are

1666
03:20:03,327 --> 03:20:07,423

1667
03:20:15,359 --> 03:20:18,687
Play frozen some distance away

1668
03:20:20,223 --> 03:20:21,759

So if centres 200200

1686
03:24:24,447 --> 03:24:25,215
And

1687
03:24:29,823 --> 03:24:35,199
Centre and you can only go so far to one side or the other

1688
03:25:01,823 --> 03:25:07,967
Sandra have you ever heard of an HTC vive a right now trying to

1689
03:25:08,223 --> 03:25:11,039
Basically code that same sort of thing

1690
03:25:12,319 --> 03:25:18,463
I like the software that runs on a computer for it but in hopes that will be able to develop her own hardware that we can

1691
03:25:18,719 --> 03:25:24,351
Use with basically the same sort of tracking systems that the HTC vive

1692
03:25:24,607 --> 03:25:26,655

1693
03:25:44,831 --> 03:25:48,927

Apple opening screen

1696
03:26:04,543 --> 03:26:07,615
Let me know can even open it

1697
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:16,319
Ok

1698
03:26:16,575 --> 03:26:17,343
What am I looking at

1699
03:26:20,415 --> 03:26:21,951
He said it

1700
03:26:22,207 --> 03:26:25,535
I would describe four words used

1701
03:27:18,271 --> 03:27:24,415
So

1702
03:27:24,671 --> 03:27:26,463
Now

1703
03:27:26,719 --> 03:27:29,023

1710
03:28:22,783 --> 03:28:28,927
I don't think so because it is so drastically wrong when it's wrong

1711
03:28:29,183 --> 03:28:34,047
Tod activator with a slight changes

1712
03:28:34,559 --> 03:28:35,839
Yes

1713
03:28:36,095 --> 03:28:40,959
The otfc only just seen your video on it

1714
03:28:41,215 --> 03:28:41,727
Ok

1715
03:28:41,983 --> 03:28:46,335
And by the way I don't want to do that when you get there that would be super cool

1716
03:28:49,407 --> 03:28:55,295
Looks like it's a lot of travelling in Berlin

1717
03:29:08,863 --> 03:29:15,007
Steam Gala so we have that data from the existing data

1718
03:29:21,663 --> 03:29:27,807
Play

1719
03:29:28,063 --> 03:29:34,207

1720
03:29:34,463 --> 03:29:35,487
Yes

1721
03:29:35,743 --> 03:29:41,887
Yes

1722
03:31:47,071 --> 03:31:53,215
Sometimes because displaying beer

1723
03:31:53,471 --> 03:31:55,775
Lighthouses on the same screen

1724
03:31:57,311 --> 03:32:03,455
If it's a update the apps from that lighthouse on giving sensor and away from that Lighthouse

1725
03:32:03,711 --> 03:32:04,735
Stop saying Santa

1726
03:32:04,991 --> 03:32:06,527
Displayed over here

1727
03:32:07,807 --> 03:32:11,647
So uses this lighthouse is that in this lighthouses why

1728
03:32:12,159 --> 03:32:18,303
The wrong lighthouse into a displays in the Wild Place

1729
03:32:18,559 --> 03:32:24,703
That would be in calibrate dotsy because right now I'm using this

1730
03:32:24,959 --> 03:32:28,543
That's just for the user presentation

1731
03:32:29,311 --> 03:32:30,847
It's just trying to music

1732
03:32:37,503 --> 03:32:41,087
Mulberry.com that up

1733
03:32:41,343 --> 03:32:47,487
I just throw out which light outside is probably the wrong way to do it

1734
03:32:47,743 --> 03:32:48,767
Ok

1735
03:33:13,599 --> 03:33:16,415
For the people in that

1736
03:33:18,975 --> 03:33:23,583
That's just a random yeah that's it

1737
03:33:23,839 --> 03:33:28,959
No no it's actually for the data when it's getting the data from that level up the program

1738
03:33:31,007 --> 03:33:33,823
Looking calibrator seeing the call back

1739
03:33:34,591 --> 03:33:35,615
Celebration

1740
03:33:40,991 --> 03:33:45,343
Yes I think I think that's it

1741
03:33:45,599 --> 03:33:46,367
Australia

1742
03:33:46,623 --> 03:33:47,647
Downlight

1743
03:33:51,231 --> 03:33:52,511
I don't know

1744
03:33:55,327 --> 03:33:58,143
Crawley Camino

1745
03:34:10,175 --> 03:34:12,479
Light blue

1746
03:36:41,727 --> 03:36:47,871
Now

1747
03:36:53,247 --> 03:36:59,391
Mum said the 0 Moran is because

1748
03:36:59,647 --> 03:37:05,791
It makes it so it's like homogeneous with this because I will have to add one in this case I will won't have to add one

1749
03:37:06,047 --> 03:37:12,191
I want to Mark off the debts actually can't like yourself no to that's going to be

1750
03:37:12,447 --> 03:37:18,591
This is access your own data access one

1751
03:37:18,847 --> 03:37:24,991
Multidimensional array

1752
03:37:28,831 --> 03:37:34,975
It here

1753
03:37:36,255 --> 03:37:37,279
Morning

1754
03:37:37,535 --> 03:37:43,679
Version of heads

1755
03:37:43,935 --> 03:37:50,079
That's ok I can get the data

1756
03:37:52,895 --> 03:37:55,199
Calibrate

1757
03:38:58,175 --> 03:39:04,319
So we used to require a Watchmen thing

1758
03:39:04,575 --> 03:39:07,903
Common point on a watchman but we don't really operate that way anymore

1759
03:39:09,695 --> 03:39:15,839
Doing it this way just obliterates

1760
03:39:22,495 --> 03:39:28,639
Can you set an alarm as done

1761
03:39:42,463 --> 03:39:47,327
Yo really would be nice if the things didn't keep flickering I really don't like that

1762
03:39:51,423 --> 03:39:52,447
My house

1763
03:39:52,703 --> 03:39:53,727
Stop

1764
03:39:54,495 --> 03:39:56,287
What do you mean by Thomas

1765
03:39:56,799 --> 03:39:57,567
Thomas

1766
03:39:57,823 --> 03:40:03,967
Goal is to get the thing itself to be able the process that I have stayed with peanuts

1767
03:40:14,975 --> 03:40:15,999
St. Paul

1768
03:40:22,143 --> 03:40:26,751
Go away

1769
03:40:38,783 --> 03:40:44,927
It's just two days working on this

1770
03:40:47,487 --> 03:40:48,511
What is the app that

1771
03:42:18,879 --> 03:42:19,903
What are you are

1772
03:42:20,159 --> 03:42:21,183
What's confusing

1773
03:42:23,231 --> 03:42:29,375
Confused about

1774
03:42:32,959 --> 03:42:33,983
I don't know either

1775
03:42:34,239 --> 03:42:39,359
Because it's the White House Whitehouse Bureau scared out

1776
03:42:39,871 --> 03:42:43,967
That I do understand

1777
03:42:45,247 --> 03:42:46,271
Yes

1778
03:42:46,783 --> 03:42:49,599
Complete before it starts

1779
03:42:49,855 --> 03:42:55,743
B it updates the position of the point in tax

1780
03:42:55,999 --> 03:42:57,791
This lighthouse this frame

1781
03:42:58,303 --> 03:42:59,583
They renders

1782
03:43:01,887 --> 03:43:06,751
So because this one just moved it this now we have this lighthouses ass

1783
03:43:07,263 --> 03:43:09,823
But we don't yet have this house is why

1784
03:43:11,615 --> 03:43:16,479
Rendering

1785
03:43:16,735 --> 03:43:17,759
Yes correct

1786
03:43:19,551 --> 03:43:23,391
So the idea that we should be using is store the pixel data

1787
03:43:23,647 --> 03:43:29,791
Is a bigger a red glasses big

1788
03:43:30,047 --> 03:43:32,095
2 months since I wrote that code

1789
03:43:35,679 --> 03:43:41,823
Stage 4 succeeded but it didn't run Dave's code

1790
03:43:51,551 --> 03:43:53,599
To do that

1791
03:44:12,799 --> 03:44:13,567
Fingers crossed

1792
03:44:14,079 --> 03:44:16,895
Are we done we can go it never you're ready by

1793
03:44:27,647 --> 03:44:31,743
So what is working on right now you know some of those lights are flickering

1794
03:44:31,999 --> 03:44:35,839
It's because we're overriding the data whilst being displayed

1795
03:44:36,095 --> 03:44:42,239
What we really should be doing is making it so that it's stored in two separate so will be able to get really clear picture

1796
03:44:42,495 --> 03:44:45,567
What dislike houses in this lighthouse is

1797
03:44:45,823 --> 03:44:47,359
Tell me the music policy

1798
03:44:52,991 --> 03:44:56,575
North Wales

1799
03:44:57,087 --> 03:44:59,647
Isolating the trenitalia

1800
03:45:00,671 --> 03:45:02,975
What is Dave saying say

1801
03:45:03,231 --> 03:45:09,375
Dave's coach says

1802
03:45:09,631 --> 03:45:14,239
Is Kodaline of crazy things

1803
03:45:16,287 --> 03:45:19,103
Do you use SDL from the debug window

1804
03:45:20,127 --> 03:45:22,687
No window

1805
03:45:23,711 --> 03:45:26,015
Ride Rise available

1806
03:45:32,671 --> 03:45:38,047
It's are completely OS independent runs on just about anything

1807
03:45:38,559 --> 03:45:44,703
You can even actually like

1808
03:45:44,959 --> 03:45:51,103
Browse by category and TV 66 you can you can use rather to do

1809
03:45:51,359 --> 03:45:52,639
3D rendering on

1810
03:45:53,151 --> 03:45:54,943
Potters is

1811
03:45:56,223 --> 03:46:00,831
Farm well

1812
03:46:02,111 --> 03:46:07,487
Is coming up with the answers 3.8 m

1813
03:46:07,743 --> 03:46:09,023
I guess ok

1814
03:46:42,303 --> 03:46:45,631
What's going on

1815
03:46:49,471 --> 03:46:51,263
Almost there Josh

1816
03:46:58,175 --> 03:46:59,967
Ride ride is very fast

1817
03:47:01,759 --> 03:47:07,647
You could use Ray tracing really like SDL light

1818
03:47:07,903 --> 03:47:13,535
It's just really small and you can just included your project and it's really geared operate on light

1819
03:47:14,303 --> 03:47:20,447
Peanuts

1820
03:47:20,703 --> 03:47:24,799
Latest free you just say hey rod rods play was bottom of the screen doesn't

1821
03:47:25,311 --> 03:47:27,359
But you got to put in the bathroom

1822
03:47:29,151 --> 03:47:35,295
Ok that's really bad why is everything not

1823
03:47:35,551 --> 03:47:40,415
Everything is not a number

1824
03:47:40,927 --> 03:47:44,767
Why is Dave's closed so broken

1825
03:48:08,063 --> 03:48:13,695
Actually also cool FM 1024

1826
03:48:17,791 --> 03:48:23,935
20

1827
03:48:32,127 --> 03:48:38,271
Play Motown

1828
03:48:38,527 --> 03:48:41,599
Pl

1829
03:49:17,183 --> 03:49:23,327
Stop playing going into Dave's code is Superbad I don't know what it is but it is time

1830
03:49:23,583 --> 03:49:29,727

How to makes you not like a sensor that would be visible from getting see when you

1840
03:51:27,231 --> 03:51:33,375
That are not in the two main things but they're on the same axis that means that's all that's coming from

1841
03:51:34,399 --> 03:51:40,543
Ok

Play a song from Brendan because I'm actually allowed to do that

1847
03:53:07,583 --> 03:53:13,727
Indeed

1848
03:53:25,503 --> 03:53:31,647

It's sofa flexing

1869
04:09:48,543 --> 04:09:54,687
I feel bad that Josh is spending $500 on a used 5 and

1870
04:09:54,943 --> 04:10:00,831
So annoying in his house

1871
04:10:37,183 --> 04:10:43,327
Brownout I'm doing I'm trying to just print out a bunch

1872
04:10:43,583 --> 04:10:44,095

1874
04:10:51,007 --> 04:10:53,823
Is going on

1875
04:10:54,079 --> 04:11:00,223
Why is Dave's code nanning all over the place

1876
04:11:04,575 --> 04:11:07,135
Using try to find the nan's

1877
04:11:09,183 --> 04:11:15,327
This particular revive I used in home when it for the week in the word

1878
04:11:15,583 --> 04:11:18,655
Glitches

1879
04:11:42,463 --> 04:11:44,511
That's pretty good

1880
04:12:00,127 --> 04:12:06,015

Dave

1884
04:13:26,911 --> 04:13:33,055
Protecting the variables

1885
04:13:33,311 --> 04:13:39,455
If you take a square root of something that's like almost exactly 0

1886
04:13:39,711 --> 04:13:42,527
Not quite zero break everywhere

1887
04:14:04,031 --> 04:14:06,079
Hello Dave's code

1888
04:14:09,151 --> 04:14:10,687

04:14:17,087 --> 04:14:23,231

1893
04:14:33,983 --> 04:14:35,007

04:14:35,263 --> 04:14:36,799
Name It Up song

1895
04:14:38,335 --> 04:14:40,383
Mordaunt-Short

1896
04:14:43,199 --> 04:14:44,223
Back up some more

1897
04:14:49,087 --> 04:14:53,439
Ok Google now if you import starts then we'll be able to get to buy them to you

1898
04:14:55,999 --> 04:14:57,023
Ignore that

1899
04:14:58,303 --> 04:14:59,583
London E20

1900
04:15:11,871 --> 04:15:13,151
Yes

1901
04:15:16,479 --> 04:15:20,831
Barely looks good outside of that that's fine

1902
04:15:21,087 --> 04:15:27,231
I like Elvis basically also become like everybody there's a budget

1903
04:15:27,487 --> 04:15:30,815
Related

1904
04:15:31,071 --> 04:15:37,215
That we may end up a dressing like a few weeks down the line so like

1905
04:15:56,671 --> 04:16:00,511
Why can't it in for a Dacia way koda

1906
04:16:17,407 --> 04:16:20,735
Skip data access

1907
04:16:24,831 --> 04:16:30,975
Which function is it

1908
04:16:31,231 --> 04:16:35,327
Nazi

1909
04:16:39,935 --> 04:16:45,311
Function

1910
04:16:49,151 --> 04:16:50,431
No that's right

1911
04:16:50,943 --> 04:16:54,783
You can definitely tell which one it is from the a code

1912
04:16:57,599 --> 04:17:03,487
I think 2 and 3 is one of the lighthouses in 6 and 7 is the other Lighthouse

1913
04:17:03,999 --> 04:17:04,767
Yeah

1914
04:17:26,015 --> 04:17:28,063
Can you explain your reasoning on that

1915
04:17:30,879 --> 04:17:33,439
Set an alarm

1916
04:17:39,327 --> 04:17:43,935
My reasoning on that is that there are total of 8 different possible a codes

1917
04:17:44,447 --> 04:17:50,591
You see that 0 and 2 and 1 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 5 and 7

1918
04:17:50,847 --> 04:17:56,991
Are all the same things that means that's the data bit or the one bit is the database 10

1919
04:17:57,247 --> 04:18:03,391
0 and 2 and 1 and 3 ride to the x-axis in the y-axis of both

1920
04:18:03,647 --> 04:18:09,791
Accordingly and also write to the x-axis and 5 and 7 write to

1921
04:18:17,727 --> 04:18:20,287
Ayx at 3

1922
04:18:20,543 --> 04:18:21,055
Correct

1923
04:18:22,847 --> 04:18:28,991
News houses jump offset x 2 + 0 office time 2 + 1 John offset x 2.0

1924
04:18:29,247 --> 04:18:35,135
I think you should be times 4 plus 0 times 4 Plus 1 times 4 plus 2 times 20

1925
04:18:35,391 --> 04:18:40,255
No work too I really have to get out of bed

1926
04:18:40,511 --> 04:18:46,655
I really have to go through a code in like a bunch of places I used one dimension

1927
04:18:46,911 --> 04:18:47,423
Personal data

1928
04:18:47,935 --> 04:18:52,031
We really need to switch it over using multidimensional arrays have an iPad

1929
04:18:56,639 --> 04:19:02,783
Turn on the light on the sound down to one

1930
04:19:14,047 --> 04:19:14,815
Ok

1931
04:19:21,471 --> 04:19:22,495
What is

1932
04:19:23,263 --> 04:19:29,407
Sienna g10x that's work starts drawing text

1933
04:19:29,663 --> 04:19:32,223
Parent controls to text location

1934
04:19:35,551 --> 04:19:39,391
Why do we care

1935
04:19:42,207 --> 04:19:46,047
Location-based

1936
04:19:51,679 --> 04:19:54,751
Maybe it's not

1937
04:19:56,799 --> 04:19:59,871
Another reason behind it

1938
04:20:02,175 --> 04:20:06,527
Shopping list

1939
04:20:29,823 --> 04:20:35,199
It's no reason to do that Dave

1940
04:21:01,055 --> 04:21:07,199
Is it good

1941
04:21:07,455 --> 04:21:13,599
Screen

1942
04:21:13,855 --> 04:21:19,999
Occasion wear

1943
04:21:20,255 --> 04:21:26,399
That happens

1944
04:21:26,655 --> 04:21:32,799
From around

1945
04:21:33,055 --> 04:21:39,199
Oh so there is another thing that I do where I if you haven't gotten data from a sensor in a while it's

1946
04:21:39,455 --> 04:21:40,223
Is it to Black

1947
04:21:40,991 --> 04:21:47,135
Here is something close

1948
04:21:50,207 --> 04:21:53,023
Yeah that looks like

1949
04:21:56,095 --> 04:22:02,239
There's another girl that used to light time the day to help him to throw it away

1950
04:22:02,495 --> 04:22:08,639
By the way

1951
04:22:08,895 --> 04:22:15,039
If you can possibly I'll put with the pie that would be pretty cool

1952
04:22:20,927 --> 04:22:27,071
I'm disconnected from your screen

1953
04:22:35,263 --> 04:22:41,407
How to play sonne Grande's going twice now

1954
04:22:41,663 --> 04:22:47,807
Nearest stop to 189

1955
04:22:48,063 --> 04:22:54,207
758

1956
04:22:54,463 --> 04:23:00,607
Staying on box light

1957
04:23:07,263 --> 04:23:13,407
Strong

1958
04:23:48,735 --> 04:23:54,879
How are you know what can you wrote

1959
04:23:55,135 --> 04:24:01,279
The headset so it's 90 degrees is right now

1960
04:24:01,535 --> 04:24:07,679
Explain why it's probably much better to do that testing with

1961
04:24:07,935 --> 04:24:14,079
New Tyler set up the grass though

1962
04:24:49,407 --> 04:24:55,551
Why do you describe this

1963
04:24:55,807 --> 04:25:01,951
I don't know why it is sometimes his thing

1964
04:25:02,207 --> 04:25:06,047
Just make everything off to one side or the other

1965
04:25:15,263 --> 04:25:21,407
Whatever I'm going to go in 2-minutes staying in I'm going to go through to him that he can hopefully fix it

1966
04:25:21,663 --> 04:25:27,807
See you next Saturday love

1967
04:25:36,511 --> 04:25:42,655
7-years wrong

1968
04:25:42,911 --> 04:25:45,983
Exactly right

1969
04:25:47,263 --> 04:25:53,407
This 12.3

1970
04:26:09,535 --> 04:26:15,167
Not too bad

1971
04:26:25,151 --> 04:26:31,295
IKEA

1972
04:26:32,575 --> 04:26:38,719
That looks much better

1973
04:26:38,975 --> 04:26:45,119
Turn on the lights

1974
04:26:47,935 --> 04:26:54,079
They're actually pretty quotes

1975
04:26:54,335 --> 04:26:56,639
I can believe

1976
04:26:56,895 --> 04:27:03,039
Committed so that it doesn't confuse everybody as it is right now

1977
04:27:10,463 --> 04:27:16,607
I don't think you will make Square things around tomorrow

1978
04:27:18,399 --> 04:27:24,543
There is definitely some data points

1979
04:27:27,103 --> 04:27:32,991
What's like rain is ok they shouldn't like freak out your animal and they are sometimes

1980
04:27:49,631 --> 04:27:55,775
Start morning if your stationary is fine

1981
04:27:56,031 --> 04:28:02,175
Add points

1982
04:28:02,431 --> 04:28:07,039
Your problems my thing than anything

1983
04:28:09,087 --> 04:28:15,231
No it's all something there

1984
04:28:17,279 --> 04:28:22,655
Hear it

1985
04:28:27,007 --> 04:28:33,151
Moving around again

1986
04:28:33,407 --> 04:28:34,175
What's the terrible corner

1987
04:28:34,431 --> 04:28:38,015
Yeah

1988
04:28:39,039 --> 04:28:41,087
Hey stop

1989
04:28:41,343 --> 04:28:44,671
Stop go back a little bit

1990
04:28:44,927 --> 04:28:46,719
Ok

1991
04:28:47,999 --> 04:28:54,143
If we met that have a more reliably ok then we can find a source that can be it

1992
04:28:54,399 --> 04:29:00,543
Ok you're gonna

1993
04:29:07,199 --> 04:29:13,343
Which lighthouse is the one on the right

1994
04:29:32,799 --> 04:29:38,943
That one

1995
04:29:45,599 --> 04:29:51,743
Ok so let's try to get to 3 Callaghan

1996
04:29:58,399 --> 04:30:04,543
Something environmental to move around again again sometime

1997
04:30:36,799 --> 04:30:42,943
Drink alcohol

1998
04:30:49,599 --> 04:30:55,743
Do the things for rotating Rachel that seems to find it

1999
04:31:40,799 --> 04:31:46,943
Turn off light

2000
04:31:59,999 --> 04:32:02,559
Next song

2001
04:32:09,215 --> 04:32:15,359
34 off to the last song

2002
04:32:15,615 --> 04:32:21,759
Turn lamp

2003
04:32:22,015 --> 04:32:28,159
Stop go back song

2004
04:32:28,415 --> 04:32:34,559
Play look around

2005
04:32:41,215 --> 04:32:47,359
Down

2006
04:32:54,015 --> 04:33:00,159
Just find it somewhere else

2007
04:33:06,815 --> 04:33:12,959
Hey there

2008
04:33:13,215 --> 04:33:19,359
Next

2009
04:34:02,367 --> 04:34:04,159
Will I find out which

2010
04:34:44,607 --> 04:34:45,887
That was weird

2011
04:34:51,007 --> 04:34:54,847
Disappear

2012
04:34:59,967 --> 04:35:01,503

2015
04:35:37,599 --> 04:35:39,135
Happened

2016
04:35:48,095 --> 04:35:50,911

Starting dieting

2025
04:37:01,567 --> 04:37:07,711
What's this just be somebody this whole time but we never really paid that much attention to it so now

2026
04:37:26,399 --> 04:37:32,543
The square pants song

2027
04:37:32,799 --> 04:37:34,335

2030
04:38:12,735 --> 04:38:17,343
How far is it to print centre number

2031
04:38:17,599 --> 04:38:22,975
You have to set the 10 X and Y and then you have to do cmfg drawer chest

2032
04:38:27,071 --> 04:38:33,215
Call Dave cook Goodenough

2033
04:41:38,559 --> 04:41:40,863
Alarm

2034
04:41:41,119 --> 04:41:43,935
I've not had a bit but I haven't

2035
04:41:44,191 --> 04:41:48,031

2039
04:42:52,287 --> 04:42:54,335
Decided

Website

2041
04:43:02,015 --> 04:43:02,783
Sorry about it

2042
04:44:01,407 --> 04:44:04,479
How do you start work if you want to invert that hose

2043
04:44:06,015 --> 04:44:08,319
Really far is e

2044
04:44:09,087 --> 04:44:11,903
S

2045
04:44:12,415 --> 04:44:13,183
What

2046
04:44:13,439 --> 04:44:18,303
WhatsApp it's a quiet and a translation trying to figure out you have to move

2047
04:44:18,815 --> 04:44:23,423
Do I have to rotate the translation by the forward quote

2048
04:44:25,471 --> 04:44:27,519
That will be on

2049
04:44:29,055 --> 04:44:32,895
Translate translate

2050
04:44:37,759 --> 04:44:43,903
Yeah that thing

2051
04:44:44,159 --> 04:44:48,255
Why am I so bad as I have never got good at that

2052
04:44:48,767 --> 04:44:50,047
Somebody trying to do

2053
04:44:50,303 --> 04:44:52,863
I have a position

2054
04:44:53,375 --> 04:44:54,399
Oven

2055
04:44:54,655 --> 04:44:57,471
Of the White House relative to the object

2056
04:44:57,983 --> 04:45:01,055
And the orientation of said Lighthouse

2057
04:45:03,871 --> 04:45:05,151
Orientation

2058
04:45:06,687 --> 04:45:12,319
Position is like very big Anna wise

2059
04:45:13,343 --> 04:45:16,415
Where the object is relative to buy house

2060
04:45:27,935 --> 04:45:30,495
NHS

2061
04:45:36,127 --> 04:45:40,479
Somebody's actually installing a minimal on a pipe

2062
04:45:49,951 --> 04:45:56,095
It's so hard to think about

2063
04:45:58,143 --> 04:46:01,727
That's going to be a very large why

2064
04:46:02,495 --> 04:46:05,055
Selby from the lighthouses point of view

2065
04:46:06,335 --> 04:46:11,455
Where the object is

2066
04:46:13,247 --> 04:46:16,831
I'm trying to determine

2067
04:46:17,087 --> 04:46:20,159
The pose of the object

2068
04:46:23,743 --> 04:46:24,767
Daesung

2069
04:46:25,023 --> 04:46:26,559
The lighthouses point of view

2070
04:46:27,839 --> 04:46:33,215
So that might actually just be here

2071
04:46:39,615 --> 04:46:40,127
Yeah

2072
04:46:41,407 --> 04:46:47,551
I think that's actually I think we can do that

2073
04:47:16,735 --> 04:47:21,599
Coronavirus

2074
04:47:41,311 --> 04:47:47,455
Tell something about yourself

2075
04:47:47,711 --> 04:47:53,855
So

2076
04:47:54,111 --> 04:48:00,255
That's the final

2077
04:48:00,511 --> 04:48:06,655
So do that

2078
04:48:13,311 --> 04:48:19,455
The Matrix holes

2079
04:48:19,711 --> 04:48:25,855
X y and z

2080
04:48:26,111 --> 04:48:32,255
Is actually going to give exactly what we want

2081
04:48:38,911 --> 04:48:45,055
Get the position and orientation of the camera

2082
04:48:45,311 --> 04:48:49,663
Misinformation

2083
04:49:08,095 --> 04:49:14,239
Carried interest

2084
04:49:18,591 --> 04:49:24,735
So that's definitely

2085
04:49:24,991 --> 04:49:31,135
Add position from the cameras point of view

2086
04:49:31,391 --> 04:49:37,535
Is that right

2087
04:49:44,191 --> 04:49:50,335
82.7

2088
04:49:50,591 --> 04:49:53,407
Around

2089
04:50:00,063 --> 04:50:06,207
And get this done

2090
04:50:06,463 --> 04:50:12,607
That information I can go back I can stop it in the object

2091
04:50:17,215 --> 04:50:23,359
Which direction

2092
04:50:23,615 --> 04:50:28,735
Travian by 10:30 then

2093
04:50:29,247 --> 04:50:35,391
Another hour

2094
04:50:35,647 --> 04:50:41,791
See I have survived Close from my house close

2095
04:50:48,447 --> 04:50:54,591
Positioning rotation of something

2096
04:50:54,847 --> 04:51:00,991
It's a different thing than like a transformation

2097
04:51:01,247 --> 04:51:07,391
Used to be under 50 Nations because it can only effect rotation and position and nothing else

2098
04:51:07,647 --> 04:51:09,183
You can't steer

2099
04:51:09,439 --> 04:51:15,583
UK

2100
04:51:44,511 --> 04:51:50,655
Paston Road

2101
04:51:57,311 --> 04:52:03,455
What's the time

2102
04:52:03,711 --> 04:52:09,855
What's the end result will be today if we can get this to work

2103
04:52:10,111 --> 04:52:16,255
Able to move the thing around the room and it will tell us in 3D space

2104
04:52:16,511 --> 04:52:22,655
Where are the battle I have sisters and would that like aspects

2105
04:52:22,911 --> 04:52:29,055
Play right now if that you can figure that the origin

2106
04:52:29,311 --> 04:52:35,455
Yes and then we pick it up and we moving around we see if those things are anywhere close to Somewhere

2107
04:52:35,711 --> 04:52:41,855
Great thing

2108
04:53:07,711 --> 04:53:13,855
Yeah that happened

2109
04:53:20,511 --> 04:53:26,655
Position

2110
04:53:27,167 --> 04:53:33,311
Ok so

2111
04:53:33,567 --> 04:53:39,711
Timer light out and divisor and looking up right now

2112
04:53:39,967 --> 04:53:41,759
I'm up

2113
04:53:42,015 --> 04:53:48,159
I want to know the position in rotation that might

2114
04:53:48,415 --> 04:53:52,767
Ratatouille

2115
04:53:53,023 --> 04:53:57,887
I have to rotate that vector from lighthouse to me

2116
04:54:06,591 --> 04:54:12,735
Why is that one way and will try to

2117
04:54:12,991 --> 04:54:19,135
This way

2118
04:54:19,391 --> 04:54:25,535
It's worth just doing I'll make a note though that we might have to swap so

2119
04:54:32,191 --> 04:54:38,335
Navigation

2120
04:54:38,591 --> 04:54:44,735
Translate

2121
04:54:44,991 --> 04:54:46,015
Play sleepy soft

2122
04:54:46,271 --> 04:54:49,087
The rotation of the inverted rotation

2123
04:54:57,535 --> 04:55:03,679
P3

2124
04:55:03,935 --> 04:55:06,495
Not doing anything

2125
04:55:26,719 --> 04:55:32,863
Do you know we're doing either

2126
04:55:33,887 --> 04:55:40,031
Paul Martin so what we have is we we

2127
04:55:40,287 --> 04:55:43,359
Now have a pose pose information

2128
04:55:43,615 --> 04:55:49,759
Of where the adjective is relative to

2129
04:55:50,015 --> 04:55:56,159
Lighthouse lady

2130
04:55:56,415 --> 04:56:01,279
The translation is almost always my the actors in frontal Lighthouse

2131
04:56:01,535 --> 04:56:05,631
Where is the object relative to Lighthouse

2132
04:56:07,935 --> 04:56:14,079
But we want to find out where the White House itself is related to the heart

2133
04:56:14,335 --> 04:56:20,479
So this is partly configuration

2134
04:56:20,735 --> 04:56:26,879
Stage on

2135
04:56:51,711 --> 04:56:57,855
Search for operating on

2136
04:58:24,639 --> 04:58:30,783
Ok

2137
04:58:31,039 --> 04:58:37,183
Scrap on diesel by 1

2138
04:59:15,839 --> 04:59:21,983
I didn't say that

2139
04:59:28,639 --> 04:59:34,783
We will basically pretended right now

2140
04:59:35,039 --> 04:59:41,183
410

2141
04:59:41,439 --> 04:59:47,583
Survive

2142
04:59:47,839 --> 04:59:53,983

Around

2156
05:01:55,839 --> 05:02:01,983
It's also made

Not first cow

2167
05:03:17,759 --> 05:03:22,367
Alright so the first time you calibrate expecting to be face up

2168
05:03:22,879 --> 05:03:29,023
But there's every time after I'm a pretty things

2169
05:03:29,279 --> 05:03:33,375
That to something else somewhere

2170
05:03:41,311 --> 05:03:47,455
Did you see you first

2171
05:03:47,711 --> 05:03:53,855
Kick off

2172
05:04:00,511 --> 05:04:02,559
Initialiser to

2173
05:04:03,327 --> 05:04:06,399

2175
05:04:13,055 --> 05:04:14,591
Time

2176
05:04:14,847 --> 05:04:20,991
So now what we do is I want to

2177
05:04:23,551 --> 05:04:25,855
Position in 3D space

2178
05:04:26,367 --> 05:04:29,183
From the lighthouses point of view

2179
05:04:30,207 --> 05:04:36,351
Position

2180
05:04:36,607 --> 05:04:38,399

I don't think that's true

2184
05:05:06,815 --> 05:05:12,959
Not soon enough

2185
05:05:13,215 --> 05:05:18,079
I want to rotate

22

2190
05:05:48,287 --> 05:05:52,383
Every time

2191
05:05:52,639 --> 05:05:54,687
Don't think so

2192
05:06:04,415 --> 05:06:07,999
Everybody happy with that

05:06:28,479 --> 05:06:34,623
Put some more properties around

2197
05:06:34,879 --> 05:06:41,023
502

2198
05:06:41,279 --> 05:06:44,095
Maybe

05:06:45,119 --> 05:06:51,263
Bad guys re

2200
05:06:51,519 --> 05:06:57,663
Will try and both ways I will try

2201
05:06:57,919 --> 05:07:04,063
Thank you Josh I will trust you and if you let me down

2202
05:07:04,319 --> 05:07:10,463
Serious problems at work

2203
05:07:10,719 --> 05:07:15,839
Off

2204
05:07:16,095 --> 05:07:22,239
Ok

2205
05:07:22,495 --> 05:07:28,639
Connect Four

2206
05:07:34,271 --> 05:07:40,415
Getting closer 513 + 1

2207
05:07:40,671 --> 05:07:46,559
Ok let's collect some data and see what it proves out

2208
05:08:03,455 --> 05:08:05,247
I think Josh is wrong

2209
05:08:06,271 --> 05:08:08,575
It should be printing the stuff it's not

2210
05:08:17,791 --> 05:08:23,935
Outside

2211
05:08:24,191 --> 05:08:27,007
No will do the file

2212
05:08:27,519 --> 05:08:33,663
Anita Slater

2213
05:08:38,271 --> 05:08:39,551
Ok

2214
05:08:57,727 --> 05:09:02,335
What's going on why is it not printing

2215
05:09:03,615 --> 05:09:05,919
Maybe if you wasn't wrong

2216
05:09:07,711 --> 05:09:08,735
First car

2217
05:09:12,063 --> 05:09:18,207
You know what

2218
05:09:18,463 --> 05:09:24,607
Skip it

2219
05:09:24,863 --> 05:09:26,655
Ok let's try this

2220
05:09:32,031 --> 05:09:35,103
They are different

2221
05:10:02,751 --> 05:10:08,127
Barnes

2222
05:10:18,623 --> 05:10:24,767
True

2223
05:10:25,023 --> 05:10:29,631
Ok

2224
05:10:38,079 --> 05:10:41,407
Take like 2-weeks just like clean up

2225
05:10:52,159 --> 05:10:54,719
Zeros where are they all zeros

2226
05:10:58,559 --> 05:11:00,095
Age 46

2227
05:11:58,463 --> 05:12:04,607
Volume

2228
05:12:13,823 --> 05:12:16,895
While light

2229
05:13:35,999 --> 05:13:39,327
Call Mamas

2230
05:13:39,839 --> 05:13:41,375
I don't know

2231
05:13:48,799 --> 05:13:50,079
Ok

2232
05:14:03,135 --> 05:14:06,975
Oh you know what there's a really good test for this if we run this

2233
05:14:07,231 --> 05:14:08,255
And it worked

2234
05:14:08,511 --> 05:14:11,327
It should say that the object is back at the Warwickshire

2235
05:14:13,887 --> 05:14:19,263
To see this and if he'll put his back if you are which is absolutely now

2236
05:14:19,519 --> 05:14:24,895
Then is perfect but it's not ok so

2237
05:14:25,407 --> 05:14:29,247
This rotation first

2238
05:14:29,503 --> 05:14:32,319
By the way Great Chart

2239
05:14:33,855 --> 05:14:36,415
Older people just wrong

2240
05:14:41,023 --> 05:14:45,119
Difference Ethos Plus

2241
05:14:46,911 --> 05:14:50,751
Add store on that still wrong

2242
05:14:55,359 --> 05:14:59,711
What is a do in Seaforth fast I can't remember

2243
05:16:14,975 --> 05:16:21,119
That looks interesting

2244
05:16:21,375 --> 05:16:27,519
Really good

2245
05:16:32,127 --> 05:16:38,271
Position

2246
05:16:38,527 --> 05:16:44,671
Can you trade a tilted on the street up and down

2247
05:16:44,927 --> 05:16:51,071
And oriented so that the white house is like that one

2248
05:16:53,631 --> 05:16:56,447
Can you check one off

2249
05:16:56,703 --> 05:17:02,847
What is the temperature

2250
05:17:06,431 --> 05:17:12,575
Volume to two

2251
05:17:12,831 --> 05:17:18,975
Like in the middle cancel it is oriented to this pop is pointed towards one

2252
05:17:19,231 --> 05:17:25,375
90 degrees but move it has physically in between the two

2253
05:17:25,631 --> 05:17:31,775
Close

2254
05:17:46,111 --> 05:17:52,255
I'm trying to oriented so that it's almost read up and dance

2255
05:17:52,511 --> 05:17:58,655
Next Spotify

2256
05:17:58,911 --> 05:18:05,055
Ok right now call there's some point in it

2257
05:18:05,311 --> 05:18:09,919
Can't actually can be useful

2258
05:18:10,175 --> 05:18:13,759
No I'm still writing the everything's fine nevermind

2259
05:18:14,015 --> 05:18:15,039
Call me back

2260
05:18:15,295 --> 05:18:21,439
Ok

2261
05:18:34,239 --> 05:18:38,079
That's with the matrices are

2262
05:18:38,335 --> 05:18:44,479
Really does look but it's not believable

2263
05:18:53,695 --> 05:18:59,839
The position on the lighthouses point of view

2264
05:19:06,495 --> 05:19:12,639
I want to get this tonight at 4

2265
05:19:17,247 --> 05:19:19,551
Fortunately

2266
05:19:21,087 --> 05:19:25,183
Very good wine

2267
05:19:39,519 --> 05:19:45,663
I forgot to do

2268
05:19:45,919 --> 05:19:52,063
Family

2269
05:20:22,015 --> 05:20:28,159
Lhp ok

2270
05:20:28,415 --> 05:20:34,559
121

2271
05:20:34,815 --> 05:20:36,863
OK girl

2272
05:20:39,679 --> 05:20:42,751
Where is like 8 things that could be reversed I don't know what they are

2273
05:20:43,007 --> 05:20:49,151
I think everything's there now if we just keep reversing things on be fine

2274
05:21:02,719 --> 05:21:08,351
That's tough one

2275
05:21:10,399 --> 05:21:13,727
What are these things that's gonna work

2276
05:21:13,983 --> 05:21:18,591
Just got to try and because I'm too tired to figure out which it actually should be

2277
05:21:25,503 --> 05:21:27,039
Alarm

2278
05:21:42,143 --> 05:21:48,287
Lights on

2279
05:22:02,879 --> 05:22:05,183
How to get from the lighthouses point of view

2280
05:22:05,695 --> 05:22:11,839
So we're starting with the internet

2281
05:22:15,679 --> 05:22:21,823
Turn off the lamp

2282
05:22:22,079 --> 05:22:24,127
Something people can see you

2283
05:22:27,967 --> 05:22:34,111
Restarting with that way

2284
05:22:34,367 --> 05:22:35,903
I am the Lighthouse in

2285
05:22:36,415 --> 05:22:38,207
Why

2286
05:22:38,719 --> 05:22:40,511
Why goes into me

2287
05:22:43,327 --> 05:22:45,119
He goes into me

2288
05:22:46,143 --> 05:22:47,679
David

2289
05:22:47,935 --> 05:22:50,495
Why did you have to make wife forward

2290
05:22:51,775 --> 05:22:56,895
How to transform from that

2291
05:23:11,231 --> 05:23:14,815
Yeah he's using wires death

2292
05:23:15,327 --> 05:23:19,423
A right-handed coordinates that is on the front

2293
05:23:21,983 --> 05:23:23,775
Wires for word

2294
05:23:27,615 --> 05:23:29,663
Forward

2295
05:23:31,199 --> 05:23:32,479
It doesn't affect x

2296
05:23:35,551 --> 05:23:37,087
It means that it would be

2297
05:23:50,655 --> 05:23:53,983
Still the only things can be clicked

2298
05:23:54,239 --> 05:24:00,383
Three times doesn't mean anything

2299
05:24:05,503 --> 05:24:06,271
Ok

2300
05:24:08,831 --> 05:24:11,647
Totally wrong but

2301
05:24:12,927 --> 05:24:14,207
I'm making progress

2302
05:24:15,743 --> 05:24:18,047
One way

2303
05:24:41,855 --> 05:24:44,159
Alarm

2304
05:24:59,007 --> 05:25:05,151

Zia

2307
05:25:39,200 --> 05:25:43,552
Ok we can solve some of these things buy

2308
05:25:43,808 --> 05:25:49,952
Play Raining more test program

2309
05:25:50,208 --> 05:25:55,584
I am going to make a castle point

2310
05:25:56,352 --> 05:26:02,496
As long as it is from my house today

2311
05:26:02,752 --> 05:26:08,896
Why not

2312
05:26:09,152 --> 05:26:10,688
Around

2313
05:26:11,712 --> 05:26:17,856

2314
05:26:31,168 --> 05:26:35,776

On

2318
05:27:37,984 --> 05:27:42,080
I just realised something

2319
05:27:43,872 --> 05:27:47,712
This should be the position of a lighthouse

2320
05:27:50,784 --> 05:27:56,928
If it's off by that much that means I can't possibly be right so something is seriously

2321
05:28:08,192 --> 05:28:14,336
The position about lighthouse Realty

2322
05:28:14,592 --> 05:28:18,176
Headset should be

2323
05:28:19,200 --> 05:28:22,272
Positive positive y0 Forex

2324
05:28:24,320 --> 05:28:27,648
The other one should be positively negative why

2325
05:28:39,936 --> 05:28:41,984
Positive y negative Z

2326
05:28:42,752 --> 05:28:46,080
Positive lion agency that's super wrong

2327
05:29:04,512 --> 05:29:05,280

2330
05:29:30,880 --> 05:29:32,928
The line between them

2331
05:29:33,184 --> 05:29:36,256
Half a litre

2332
05:29:47,776 --> 05:29:48,544
Maybe

2333
05:29:49,056 --> 05:29:55,200
Am I try on doing the transformation that Dave

2334
05:29:55,456 --> 05:29:59,552
I'm going to try and do in the transformation I made that tried to cancel that

2335
05:30:02,624 --> 05:30:03,648
Don't touch it down

2336
05:30:17,728 --> 05:30:23,872
I'm not sure they started word I'm seeing now from Dave's code

2337
05:30:24,128 --> 05:30:28,992
That's something that

2338
05:30:29,248 --> 05:30:32,064
Looks relatively good

2339
05:30:32,320 --> 05:30:36,672
Cos that's a positive z and negative y a positive Z

2340
05:30:36,928 --> 05:30:43,072
A positive values for x

2341
05:30:43,328 --> 05:30:48,704

2342

This is one Factor

Can you call Cody about 9

2351
05:32:30,592 --> 05:32:33,152
It doesn't have to be exact

2352
05:32:33,408 --> 05:32:38,016
I can be like this and that's fine used to normalise re-enter

2353
05:32:55,680 --> 05:33:01,824
It's easy to change the code and look at the party changed the whole thing

2354
05:33:02,080 --> 05:33:03,360
All wrong

2355
05:33:04,128 --> 05:33:05,152

2357
05:33:22,560 --> 05:33:27,936
After to do something like the pose

2358
05:33:54,048 --> 05:33:54,816
Do you know what

2359
05:34:16,320 --> 05:34:19,136
I'm from BrightHouse is point of view so

2361
05:34:35,776 --> 05:34:37,056

2362
05:35:54,880 --> 05:35:57,952
Idea

2363
05:36:44,032 --> 05:36:50,176
I'm doing the same thing I do love down here

2364
05:36:52,480 --> 05:36:54,528
I think that might be the key

2365
05:36:56,832 --> 05:36:58,368
Two

2366
05:36:59,392 --> 05:37:01,184
Because they should know if I am

2367
05:37:04,512 --> 05:37:09,376
Feels like this is algebraically wrong but maybe we can

2368
05:38:12,352 --> 05:38:15,424
Pressing on times of that happening

2369
05:38:29,248 --> 05:38:29,760

Wonder on here

2386
05:42:11,968 --> 05:42:16,320
Pause

2387
05:42:35,008 --> 05:42:38,336
Show sing x route should be the same date of the heating

2388
05:42:54,208 --> 05:42:55,744
Changing

2389
05:42:58,560 --> 05:43:00,096
23047

2390
05:43:06,496 --> 05:43:10,848
02035

2391
05:43:23,648 --> 05:43:29,024
Play it down I stupid

2392
05:43:29,536 --> 05:43:35,680
Turn off

2393
05:43:46,688 --> 05:43:52,320
I know

2394
05:43:58,464 --> 05:44:04,352
I was looking at this number

2395
05:44:08,192 --> 05:44:12,288
Compared to what the code of fair is getting so it is the same status good

2396
05:44:12,544 --> 05:44:15,104
On so

2397
05:44:20,736 --> 05:44:24,320
Until

2398
05:44:51,968 --> 05:44:56,064
We would rotate by something but I don't know why yet

2399
05:45:16,800 --> 05:45:17,568
Ok

2400
05:45:17,824 --> 05:45:23,968
This time it was accurate with the same answer two of them mm of the last time that time I've got with in a millimetre

2401
05:45:24,224 --> 05:45:29,088
Ok that's something here

2402
05:45:31,648 --> 05:45:37,792
Yeah that's moving so now he had to rotate

2403
05:45:38,048 --> 05:45:38,816
Degrees

2404
05:45:44,960 --> 05:45:48,544
Around any perpendicular vector

2405
05:45:49,568 --> 05:45:55,712
Cos it's going if I move that way it's gonna move with respect to the White House

2406
05:45:55,968 --> 05:46:02,112
Ok so move it to see the plus x on top moving plus extra x

2407
05:46:04,672 --> 05:46:06,208
Ok

2408
05:46:09,792 --> 05:46:14,400
The chairs something out no it's getting a bunch of Clans

2409
05:46:14,656 --> 05:46:17,984
Starting at 8 again

2410
05:46:23,872 --> 05:46:24,640
Ok

2411
05:46:24,896 --> 05:46:31,040
So in one case included in the boss xx in the other included in the minus x

2412
05:46:31,552 --> 05:46:34,112
To the Lighthouse

2413
05:46:36,928 --> 05:46:43,072
We have to rotate that by the Lighthouse Factor by the

2414
05:46:43,328 --> 05:46:45,376
Sieve Factor

2415
05:46:48,192 --> 05:46:49,728
What's the percent vector

2416
05:46:56,640 --> 05:46:57,664
Play

2417
05:46:59,456 --> 05:47:05,600
X 12 happened

2418
05:47:18,144 --> 05:47:20,192
Somewhere

2419
05:47:24,544 --> 05:47:25,824
OK to use it back

2420
05:47:41,440 --> 05:47:42,464
So

2421
05:47:50,144 --> 05:47:52,960
Destiny -1 one

2422
05:47:57,056 --> 05:47:58,848
Positive why

2423
05:48:02,688 --> 05:48:05,760
B and m

2424
05:48:50,304 --> 05:48:54,144
Irritation

2425
05:49:10,784 --> 05:49:14,112
I guess just why

2426
05:49:15,648 --> 05:49:17,440
Brought it to myself

2427
05:49:25,888 --> 05:49:28,704
Not right

2428
05:49:29,216 --> 05:49:29,984
I'm back

2429
05:49:34,336 --> 05:49:35,872
Well

2430
05:49:42,528 --> 05:49:44,576
So close

2431
05:49:45,088 --> 05:49:50,720
Five minutes just five more minutes

2432
05:49:50,976 --> 05:49:53,536
Are so close now

2433
05:50:50,112 --> 05:50:53,184
That way

2434
05:50:57,024 --> 05:50:58,560
Ok it's out of order

2435
05:51:01,888 --> 05:51:04,960
Rotation translation

2436
05:51:55,904 --> 05:52:00,512
This one does not work I will give up tonight

2437
05:52:16,640 --> 05:52:17,408
Turn all wrong

2438
05:52:17,920 --> 05:52:22,528
Ok what's on Dubai

2439
05:52:51,712 --> 05:52:57,856
Is part is all wrong

2440
05:52:58,880 --> 05:53:00,928
Back to 0

2441
05:53:07,584 --> 05:53:09,632
Guitar guitar

2442
05:53:10,912 --> 05:53:11,680
Ok

2443
05:53:12,448 --> 05:53:15,264
What's the least try to think about this so we have

2444
05:53:17,568 --> 05:53:23,712
The vector

2445
05:53:23,968 --> 05:53:25,760
The headset as the Orchard

2446
05:53:26,016 --> 05:53:30,624
Then days code gives us

2447
05:53:30,880 --> 05:53:35,232
Where are the position of the headset is relative to that

2448
05:53:35,488 --> 05:53:41,632
The Lighthouse from the Lighthouse is the origin

2449
05:53:41,888 --> 05:53:42,912
Ok

2450
05:53:43,168 --> 05:53:44,192
Dan

2451
05:53:44,448 --> 05:53:46,496
From

2452
05:53:46,752 --> 05:53:50,336
Peter athletics position in 3D space

2453
05:53:50,848 --> 05:53:52,384
What we do is we take

2454
05:53:52,640 --> 05:53:58,784
That vector

2455
05:54:00,832 --> 05:54:02,368
Here to there

2456
05:54:02,624 --> 05:54:08,768
I had that that's why I do do 360°

2457
05:54:16,960 --> 05:54:21,824
The victories yes yes

2458
05:54:22,592 --> 05:54:23,872
The weight of the vector

2459
05:54:25,664 --> 05:54:30,272
Down the hill yes that's all we have right now

2460
05:54:31,040 --> 05:54:35,904
It's not working because when you now were operating within white

2461
05:54:36,416 --> 05:54:39,744
Pretending that's at the origin so would move that way

2462
05:54:40,000 --> 05:54:44,096
Removing around in 3D space from that point of view

2463
05:54:44,864 --> 05:54:51,008
So how are you

2464
05:54:51,264 --> 05:54:54,336
Why are we moving at lights

2465
05:54:54,848 --> 05:54:59,456
Anywhere

2466
05:55:08,416 --> 05:55:09,696
So

2467
05:55:13,536 --> 05:55:14,816
We start with

2468
05:55:15,072 --> 05:55:17,120
Caroline has one of you better

2469
05:55:17,632 --> 05:55:18,656
Occasion

2470
05:55:18,912 --> 05:55:25,056
Around so now I have the 3D corners of the lights

2471
05:55:25,312 --> 05:55:25,824
Yes

2472
05:55:26,336 --> 05:55:29,920
So now when he sees me something

2473
05:55:30,432 --> 05:55:32,992
It's from the point of view

2474
05:55:33,248 --> 05:55:38,368
Are the Lighthouse change so of you change an extra to the Lighthouse

2475
05:55:42,208 --> 05:55:43,488
So

2476
05:55:45,280 --> 05:55:47,072
Why are you what is that

2477
05:55:48,864 --> 05:55:51,424
Because

2478
05:55:51,680 --> 05:55:54,752
I don't know how to explain that that's just the Way It Is Right Now

2479
05:55:55,264 --> 05:55:57,056
We have to get a roti

2480
05:55:57,312 --> 05:55:59,616
We never rotated back into world

2481
05:56:00,128 --> 05:56:01,152
Rotation

2482
05:56:02,176 --> 05:56:03,456
We've been stuck in

2483
05:56:03,712 --> 05:56:05,504
Lighthouse rotation

2484
05:56:07,296 --> 05:56:12,672
Which should be fine with that will get you the position of that in Whitehouse rotation

2485
05:56:13,952 --> 05:56:16,000
Maybe we get that in the rotator

2486
05:56:16,256 --> 05:56:19,072
By the station

2487
05:56:20,352 --> 05:56:23,680
Is only get the position from that it's from the lighthouses

2488
05:56:24,192 --> 05:56:28,032
Like I said a whole rotation like thing going on

2489
05:56:28,800 --> 05:56:34,944
And Israel now when you move in that like that way it's saying Oh I'm in that direction

2490
05:56:35,200 --> 05:56:41,344
Relative to my thing which is totally different in 3D space

2491
05:56:41,600 --> 05:56:44,928
So it may actually just be as simple as a notation

2492
05:57:01,824 --> 05:57:04,128
By the object so

2493
05:57:09,248 --> 05:57:12,832
Do something useful to begin with

2494
05:57:14,880 --> 05:57:15,904
Ok set

2495
05:57:16,160 --> 05:57:17,952
That time

2496
05:57:18,208 --> 05:57:22,048
That's just because that was a pretty good waiter test something

2497
05:57:34,848 --> 05:57:37,664
Thoroughly freaking out ok

2498
05:57:40,480 --> 05:57:41,248
Mouse

2499
05:57:42,528 --> 05:57:46,112
I think something is really trying it offers on bed are you

2500
05:57:50,208 --> 05:57:53,024
Still looks like it's being rotated

2501
05:58:06,592 --> 05:58:12,736
Mia forget it I think we might have to roti like ahead of time and then do everything world

2502
05:58:12,992 --> 05:58:19,136
Something like that is right now or operating in the local space that

2503
05:58:19,392 --> 05:58:25,536
I'm sorry guys we failed this was a failure or we tried it's good things come in

2504
05:58:25,792 --> 05:58:31,936
Turn on going home

2505
05:58:32,192 --> 05:58:36,800
You can stay if you want stuff in the morning

2506
05:58:41,920 --> 05:58:44,480
Add

2507
05:58:44,736 --> 05:58:49,088
Skip

2508
05:58:50,112 --> 05:58:56,256
Almost 14 poser information staff

Calibre cleaning

2512
05:59:36,192 --> 05:59:42,336
Why is it crash

CTS driver seat

2514
05:59:50,016 --> 05:59:53,600

2515
05:59:56,928 --> 05:59:58,208
Broken

2516
05:59:59,744 --> 06:00:05,888

2518
06:00:12,544 --> 06:00:18,688
Did not pick up the device or something

2519
06:00:18,944 --> 06:00:24,576
No this is the contact the contacts couldn't care less if the device is turned on

2520
06:00:44,544 --> 06:00:50,688
Are you die

2521
06:00:53,760 --> 06:00:58,624
Calibrate of a calibre line 177

2522
06:01:22,944 --> 06:01:25,504
Why did you set this B up

2523
06:01:25,760 --> 06:01:29,600
That's good that one

2524
06:01:30,368 --> 06:01:36,512
You didn't

Can you set the alarm

2535
06:03:28,896 --> 06:03:31,712
Code

2536
06:03:34,784 --> 06:03:40,416
Start something ok

2537
06:03:56,544 --> 06:04:00,640
Something in Calgary

2538
06:04:01,152 --> 06:04:07,296
What do

2539
06:04:07,552 --> 06:04:12,928
Turn on my lamp

2540
06:04:13,184 --> 06:04:15,744
Just look at that map

2541
06:04:16,000 --> 06:04:18,560
News

2542
06:04:20,352 --> 06:04:26,496
Turn fast set times to turn half cylinder sensor ID

Stuff

2544
06:04:44,416 --> 06:04:49,536
Yes the start already

2545
06:04:50,816 --> 06:04:56,960
I remember seeing a dead one and two please

2546
06:04:59,264 --> 06:05:04,384
Hey

2547
06:05:18,208 --> 06:05:24,352
5

2548
06:05:24,608 --> 06:05:30,752
Fixed

2549
06:05:31,008 --> 06:05:37,152
Find out why that was negative

2550
06:05:37,408 --> 06:05:43,552
Actually the post

2551
06:05:43,808 --> 06:05:45,088
This sometimes

2552
06:05:45,856 --> 06:05:51,744
Never crashed before that's a really good question maybe a lot of other problems before had to do with that

2553
06:05:52,000 --> 06:05:54,816
Do I don't think I'll problem tonight at to do with that so

2554
06:05:59,168 --> 06:06:04,800
That's really nice Josh actually that really is nice

2555
06:06:07,104 --> 06:06:13,248
Is don't trashed

2556
06:06:13,504 --> 06:06:19,648
Next Josh's accidental
