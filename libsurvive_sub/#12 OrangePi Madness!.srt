00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Hello everybody and thank you for coming out to this V12 I think you're up to our lives

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
Five live stream and this was really fun because I got a Snow Day today

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
Go watch the snow out my window while working on all the stuff now an ordinary we kind of

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
Spaced out all of the live streams over a fairly wide bit of time and that was because

5
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,256
We were going fairly slow until I'll buy no friend who is also known as

6
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,656
As I G David Berger on who is apparently neither albino or French

7
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
Decided to start contributing to live survive and all my he really

8
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Hi Gear here with the probably a couple hundred can be it's over the

9
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,248
Couple weeks here

10
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm actually really curious I can see that on his profile here

11
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,904
My where are you to David Berger

12
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
How do I get to you

13
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
J David Berger get up so this guy

14
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
When is this guy has been committing tons and tons of stuff including

15
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
In epmp poser now for Life survival were trying to do is figure out where

16
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Houses and then what's mean

17
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Houses are based on the headset then we can figure out where the this the hmd is in 3D

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
Yeah we're also able to figure out where virtually any other devices are including not artificial valve

19
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,008
Traxxas so hopefully like survival be fairly

20
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Versatile in wide-ranging as far as it uses could be so what we've been trying

21
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
You up until now hours can create all of these different poses and algorithms in order to take the sweeps of light as they say

22
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,720
Cross and figure out where the thing is now up until now we have been

23
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Last in spectacular this and that was why I guess the last week or so

24
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
When she started getting done

25
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
Is he was able to actually did through now in all of that there were a number of problems found deep within the other light

26
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Core part of life survive the problems is his poses right now require the use of sea

27
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Aegon

28
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
Can I fly to the long-term before right now I am more than happy to take his stuff with all the odd ball

29
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
It's fine because it got us moving it found tons of problems and we have a much better system for

30
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
4

31
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Well

32
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
Running the whole life survive new configuration option tech right now I can run it with Kim

33
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Decoration auction so like if I go at it like config json and I looking here

34
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
Headlight default poser poser territory which is the default browser instead I want to say

35
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
On closer is a default closure is poser

36
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm now deciding if I go do that look at this it's selected by P&P poser you can actually use

37
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
Turn the line flags and their useful now which is like

38
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
Turn my Hall live he's also one of ridiculously awesome stuff which is like so I can

39
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Unlike a data recorder

40
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
Headset back in its place

41
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
Which I will bring to you guys attention

42
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
I'm so right there sitting on that chair is the headset and what were

43
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Time do you were going to go wrong data recorder recorder the normal way that you wanted

44
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:17,536
We're going to run data recorded in the ridiculous work on

45
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
Also he developed the whole play Back to Black

46
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Playback system

47
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
No this is just

48
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Insane on somebody go use websocket d with data recorder and

49
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Go on

50
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
I'm going to go look in the tools free power and then under here there is like this thing that

51
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
Find it is right here you go open up this thing

52
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
This is using

53
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
I think it's ridiculous it's using this thing website and that's just a regular

54
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,407
And so now we can visualise where the

55
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
The

56
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
In 3D space

57
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
On

58
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
Ghost weakness

59
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,183
Set up doing that I'm going to go use

60
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,815
Will actually go use the pozary P&P for both a cow

61
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
Fig

62
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
Things running radio

63
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Ok so we're going to go run this

64
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Ok

65
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Refresh

66
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
No I don't want you to

67
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:04,031
UPnP

68
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Like dynamically

69
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,967
Using pozary PNP now for everything

70
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Cancel is doing the ODEON Exeter

71
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,855
I'm so just got packets 0 packets 0

72
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
Come on Forest other packets

73
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
Set down to the wife not running first

74
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Calibrate

75
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Making lighthouses

76
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,111
I know what's going on here

77
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
Macmillan do it that way

78
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,887
Accused poser Kirby Tory for the other thing

79
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
Word cloud

80
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Hopefully they'll be faster

81
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,023
Can you use the

82
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
Banakum use the Kirby big you later ok

83
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,615
I hope that was supposed to be just a quick presentation

84
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
Ok now to actually running

85
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
What I want to do I want to set

86
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,999
Allowed to Thailand

87
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
The whole time I could just get that one value and everything would have been fine

88
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
On Hay can something of an A1

89
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
PC does not run on a on that quite yet though there will be a time

90
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
And we'll see how that goes ;-) I'm actually doing a port myself for itself

91
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,671
The right now this is

92
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Getting vo2max data

93
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Continuing

94
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
Hopefully this is actually going to work right now

95
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Pingo to check this out better I'll buy your friend she me

96
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,359
I'm going to go pick this up and moving around

97
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,455
Can you can see that it is actually working

98
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
Design move this around

99
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
It's glitching up pretty bad

100
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Bye

101
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
He is able to take his cpnp poser and it does solve for the position of

102
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
The headset now between the lighthouses for this

103
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
Quite something that we can use other poses for SE18

104
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
News on Jose

105
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
I Dave ortho

106
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
Anyway to do the same sort of thing

107
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
Refresh has a couple problems with it one is that does not do any Fusion

108
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,631
Clean the lighthouses so you can see that shows both lighthouses point of view

109
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,519
P&P and this application is actually much slower than

110
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,431
Much slower is much slower than I would like it's only getting 240hz

111
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,783
Where is something like dave author was getting absolutely absurd speed

112
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
But the Solutions that a morpho put out just as good as the EP and he song

113
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,583
So that means the least for the time being we are married to

114
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,447
What was the other one

115
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,079
We were married to keep class and Lockie

116
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
So there's that

117
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,735
Interesting things if you use the same holder to do both

118
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,367
So like really I'm gonna calibrate the system using the dbortho closer

119
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Or not

120
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
Ok now to using the composer for Dior

121
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
On

122
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
And that

123
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Ok sorry now this is using purely Dave ortho for calibration and for

124
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
Operation and you can see that it's not great

125
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
20 days work

126
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
So

127
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,631
If you only had someone that's all we really looking at

128
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
Then like you can see that I can point there I could actually point it at the

129
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
At the webcam

130
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Guys

131
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,783
Set interesting the Den I guess I don't really have the webgl thing

132
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
Pointing out from the camera point of view but yeah so this is this is actually working and it's

133
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
Ridiculous

134
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
If you're going to get you something

135
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,287
What are you are the hero of the week between all these ridiculous tools that you've added

136
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
And this functionality

137
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Arm

138
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
No yes

139
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Do you want to make sure that this will work with the 30-day later

140
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
I think and the distance is what handles the light pulses

141
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,351
And Tamsin into meaning for angles to the rest of the system can operate

142
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
So I'm going to go

143
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,007
Hopefully this will still work with the curvy

144
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Disambiguated

145
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
Hey I have no idea has been entirely too long since I've written

146
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
Justin Waite

147
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
Is ok so are you albinos French DJ David burger or Justin Berger and why David W

148
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Stop listening Justin David burger

149
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,631
But yeah you were truly the hero of

150
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
For a while here

151
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,567
I can't seem to get terveys disambiguating Running With

152
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Rang the situation

153
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
You're like a tribe I could just try use one lighthouse for right now

154
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,879
What's easier

155
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
Think you can calibrate using one

156
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,943
War movie does ignores me and operated with both

157
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Settle

158
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
Will definitely have to get some work done to get the

159
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,351
Justin

160
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,959
Can I call you Justin what should I call you

161
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:08,639
Adam can you Benny for

162
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Hozier

163
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,647
SDA and poser

164
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
Beta-2

165
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
That's right right

166
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Justin pozary pm-te

167
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
ASDA

168
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,599
This should work out of Becky white houses

169
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
And we'll keep using turveys

170
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
Ok what's try using the child 1

171
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,919
Hey Justin I have never actually use your ASDA before

172
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
So is Anna messages I'm seeing hear about a canary Prada original reproject

173
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Is that expected

174
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
What is that on expected

175
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
Oh my gosh it's a stable

176
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Little Jackie

177
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Little clarkie

178
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
What is working

179
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
It's actually working

180
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
ASDA Photo

181
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
Change that

182
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
The hottest girls

183
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Checking on discord

184
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
Our yes that is one of the big things I really want to do I really want to be able to take

185
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
Sp32 strap a to a couple of the senses and making an add-on for your phone so you can look in

186
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,351
The three-dimensional world almost like an ar system

187
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,983
I don't really think it's an interesting this mean like replacing Google cardboard but I think this is

188
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:19,103
Really need it now what does the SBA say with this

189
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
Oh you gotta be kidding me

190
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
Oh guys look at this

191
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
That

192
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
This is incredible

193
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,167
So it's jaggedy and all that there's no imu sensor Fusion

194
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
What are so I guess we should probably get started for the day we spend about half an hour recapping everything

195
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
Going on

196
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,223
With with life survive and

197
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,343
Now what the goal is

198
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
So this

199
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
I am I hope you was watching

200
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Q

201
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,871
Are you watching the

202
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
Ok

203
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
So I have right here a orange pi

204
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
Play wine listening is like Tiny actually I do have to add a heatsink to this

205
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Get down to do that while working on it I'll be there this thing right here normally like

206
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
They have a duck like that enough to Alperton the vibe in the vibe on fortunately has

207
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Very restrictive set of modes that it allowed to operate in so you

208
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
Operative ID at all if you can't drive a resolution that matches the

209
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
One the stupid 12 or 2160 by 1200 that requires which is

210
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
Would preclude operating on something with very limited hardware except

211
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
Orange Pi has a dark clock that can just eat by so it does mean

212
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
Turnpike an output to the 5th some problems in that there is no kernel there wasn't the current

213
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,575
Few days ago that would be able to actually run

214
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
No actually be able to run

215
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,743
The Mali drivers the video card drivers

216
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
B

217
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Thankfully

218
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,447
I can't about this lifestream which was the best person ever been going to see this later but then was like

219
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
Play Somebody put a project on hiatus for a year

220
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
Need it went on hiatus but they came back in the finished and I had to make some Carol patches and I'm still trying to

221
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
Some things ran through the main line it's not going so hard they don't really like my recommendations and I spent hour

222
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:12,159
How to send an email so they all go through but

223
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,975
Regardless what I do have

224
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,375
I have this little guy right here and one thing I can run on it

225
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,447
What I'll do is I'll see you guys going to unplug

226
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
The arm

227
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,639
The projector output which is projecting over there she can't really see that you don't really

228
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:39,039
B2c environment to do is plug in the five

229
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
Sufficient I think needs to be rebooted even better just decide to reboot itself

230
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
What's

231
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
It's little dealio

232
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
I'm gonna go kill live survivor here

233
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:09,247
Close that window

234
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,048
Ok

235
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Miss me

236
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
Play one thing we can do is cat daddy

237
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,136
Random into Dev fp0

238
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
Ok so if you look inside here

239
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,472
Get all jaggedy

240
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:14,784
How do I set that should be

241
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,440
Oh no I need to do that with

242
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,560
Cubic view

243
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,576
So now you can see that this is a large pie is actually are putting to the Vibe

244
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:53,440
Thought I had it working with the drivers but I guess not

245
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,144
Can't initialise by GL50

246
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
Sonic build RC

247
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:18,272
Ok I'm just try reinstalling device drivers

248
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
Is it

249
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,160
I haven't seen anyway in a while still working

250
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
I'm an idiot

251
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,424
I started somebody type something make sure that the

252
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
The child is working

253
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,384
Ok I actually ctrl-c did I don't know what I why did that by accident

254
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,112
Also increase game song

255
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Anyway

256
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,048
IPhone

257
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
Try rebooting again

258
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,408
Silicone turning there was a DPF issue

259
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,952
No be crazy if this is a but for something I thought I had working

260
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,816
There is actually a bunch of stuff that

261
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
Ok

262
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
So you know what

263
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
What is a core dump

264
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Inside the channel so it's power off and back on

265
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,328
The other interesting things the

266
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,936
Even the Bootloader knows how to help with the device which is just while

267
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
How to really see it in there

268
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
Going

269
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,752
Device

270
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
Working

271
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
Can you find the mode

272
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
Yeah probably take about 5

273
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Play minutes but it's something we're going to have to do to get it working in sewing keep on moving

274
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Where is that

275
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,744
No I don't want to delete emojis before breeding that's half the fun of watching you guys

276
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,072
Heating just stop

277
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Off

278
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Ok

279
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
Wow

Arch arm too

282
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,616
1direction

283
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
That's interesting

284
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
Sure that's copy tilde slash son

285
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,216
I'm so what I'm doing right now is doing these files the DTS files within

286
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:00,384
Ok you know what it's some point I'm going to just have to the band hymns

287
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,968
Somehow I don't even know

288
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,808
Is just going to keep making emails or is

289
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
Yeah the bridge light is on

290
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
Whatever

291
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
The description on bridge is get hard

292
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:38,016
Social media tools and in here it is

293
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,648
Tchat monitor Bridge discord and then the other one is

294
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
VR

295
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
Well live survive years get hard

296
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,936
Ok

297
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:02,336
Very go go go go go make a thing so I can get rid of specific

298
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
Play anybody doing

299
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
Anywhere

300
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
G-board

301
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,792
So I'm going to go copy it so anyway on the all-weather trip like the arm

302
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
Lyrics system-on-chip things what they're trying to do is there trying to unify the kobeissi they can use the same kernels

303
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,592
Different light configuration items so these DTS files describe a high level what the harbour loadout

304
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
Including like white part of memory things are found in that kind of stuff so you can have something it says like

305
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
I'm in orange Pi 1

306
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
Col go do your thing and it will automatically KNOWHOW all of that set up now I spent hours

307
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
Been through it trying to figure out how the world to use it works now I'm good

308
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,960
This is one of the files that I was trying to get them to patch this still haven't matched it on

309
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,544
I'm really bad at getting people upstream to do things

310
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,872
I just don't know how to make that happen

311
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Anyway

312
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm going to

313
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,088
What's make sure

314
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
What's copy Dad

I can say vtbd TDS install

316
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
Ok so

317
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976

318
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,888

Yes Dan

331
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,008
Ok fingers crossed that we will actually get 3D this time

332
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Don't know the I fell off

333
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600

00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,608
Are the triangles are a lot of them and it's rendering this at 90 FPS

A $19 computer so my goal is to in a couple weeks

352
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
Maybe have a something that you could actually play Like a video game that you can play in the vibe it's probably going by

00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
You command in headset

356
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
I don't know what's ematrix is

357
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:52,032
Orange Pi Amazon this is an orange Pi 1 not in orange Pi PC

358
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
Have an orange Pi PC here I haven't actually looked it up yet but it should work with the five

359
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,272
While I think about it let me go fix the game

360
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
That looks better

361
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,888
Also 1960 11 to 52

362
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
I'm not also fixed the

363
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
Hello

364
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
I don't know these controls deal

365
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
I assure you it's very bright up there

366
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
I don't really know what the cameras doing

367
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Ok

368
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
Artsy what are people saying in chat

369
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,600
You can read the catalogue from the Viber made me to the Carol

370
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,696
$90 Amazon

371
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,072
Art like this all the time

372
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
Yeah dude 6.8 asteroids that would be the way

373
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,872
I'm thinking the things going to have no time keeping up with on the 5 with wireframe

374
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,272
I don't think it's going to be able to draw very much because between clearing the screen and rendering

375
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
Triangles wants and then rendering like overlap for a factor of 2 it can't keep up and that

376
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
Are you the shader it is so minimal it is in Spain

377
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,400
This is the shader

378
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
Were used to doing like 100 operations in the shooter something it's kind of

379
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,104
Generally is minimal nowadays like

380
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
What is cmatrix I don't also I don't have

381
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,904
A keyboard up to it so I can't really type things into it on

382
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,304
Anyway this GPU is literally that the fragment shader

383
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,704
Is literally the pixel into the buffer Indian like ok it's Toronto

384
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,104
Stop this all of this this all brings us to what we're actually doing today

385
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,504
The Matrix in my mind

386
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,904
Vibe headset that's strange

387
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,304
Sometime but not right now for this part

388
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
We're going to change the chat window because we have now done

389
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
Last 2-weeks and now are going to be putting rod raw on

390
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,904
Ok also that way so there we go

391
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,304
R2c

392
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,704
Oh come on I trying to actually spend almost the entire time actually recapping stuff and I would imagine this

393
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
The interesting for you are I would hope it's been pretty interesting to you all see if the viewer count to 100

394
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,504
So yeah I'm going to go with this was a pretty good livestream so far what we're going to do though

395
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
Is so smooth you guys might be aware of Rodger it's how we are we operate a number of things like a

396
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Can you tell us 4 cm pick so if I say see anything google.com

397
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,704
Right here is strong or FIFA

398
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,304
RC I can type without

399
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,704
Placing my fingers ok

400
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,104
Check

401
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,504
You can help in web addresses this is actually pinging http

402
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,904
Call back home within HTTP thing

403
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
But I think this is just to burst swanky because like it's actually require

404
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,704
I'm from Google by K can I get that webpage in your actually paying it and you can do this

405
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,104
So somebody wanted deportes en paying over the Android like you actually could now

406
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,504
If anybody does want to port City anything over to Google please do so

407
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,904
See hear

408
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
My friend just texted me she was administered she says if I won't lie

409
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,704
Everytime it snowed I'd never get off my phone

410
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,104
Actually no day anyway

411
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,504
You being close all that over trying to do right now is trying to make a on

412
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
Etl driver for Rod rod and what is going to do is going to give us a common platform to be able to

413
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,304
Draw things inside the bike headset on this is gonna be really valuable because rod rod something that we

414
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,704
Unlike use and test in other environments as well so we're not limited in so far as the

415
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,080
Development in developing and developed in really specific things

416
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,480
What are you annoying thing as egl completely removes immediate mode so you have to claim a fake It Yourself

417
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
Which is a little bit awkward

418
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
Can you just do it anyway so

419
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
Alright now as you guys can see is supporting rudra and that would be important to the headset

420
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,752
Understand the end goal for today is to be able to see an object in 3D space

421
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:53,151
Please may I be able to move the headset and heavy object kind of see

422
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:58,783
Still a little bit during that so yeah

423
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,135
Gomovies

424
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,631
Ok so what I have in St cyr

425
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:20,031
Raja cmfg you can do things like a pixel which would go out put one more

426
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:26,431
Pixel to the screen on a specific location or tax segment which would take a segment cheapest

427
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,831
Line segment to the screen at the specific location so these are all really basic

428
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
We have to in order to work with egl we're gonna have to put them into offers

429
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,047
Turn my problem we go setup

430
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,119
Excuse me setup a buffer and alcoholic

431
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:51,519
Alarm in specific to Marty

432
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
I was same a maltese whatever same thing because it's really fast

433
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,783
It doesn't have any of the composites of slow down it's it's just

434
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,183
It's super duper fast so you can even use it in the arms and it feels real time

435
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:15,583
Anyway so I was actually working on tax segment on before I started on

436
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,983
We're going to go now so what you can do there

437
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,383
Briefings X1 y1 X2 Y2 and

438
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,783
Colour butter

439
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
We want to make that x

440
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:49,375
Because we have a line a colour for this segment and a colour for the end

441
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,935
Text we have a colour basically

442
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
X 2 she know how the lines worth with Tom

443
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
With with a g l e s wear with dark PGL so we'll see

444
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Alarms

445
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,887
See how that goes so next is

446
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,335
Vgl

447
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,943
Acquired

448
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
Sergio quads

449
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
What is that

450
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:06,431
Airlines tier points and what are they

451
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
We have

452
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:15,135
TCL lines GL triangles to quads

453
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,999
I'll put quads

454
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:31,263
3

455
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,663
Accounting for rectangles of that uses the background colour of the foreground colour

456
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:44,063
So inside here

457
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,463
Tack rectangle that doesn't really tell me much

458
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,863
Brush based off of last

459
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:05,055
Yes so uses the EGR currentcolor

460
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:15,039
Ok cos there's four points

461
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:33,471
We'll see if I can keep ringing back Morar YouTube I chat stuff I'm glad for this one I was able to get the

462
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
Thing up and running

463
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
I'm really happy with that what is your question with GLS less than 2

464
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
I don't know what you're on

465
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,063
You got you do are you serious read

466
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
What is this the

467
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,927
Oh my gosh you guys but so depressing

468
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Why would the

469
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,047
Why do people get rid of things that are so good

470
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
So wait so it'll be

471
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,503
I guess I really only had two triangles then right there's no

472
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Heart

473
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
Whatever

474
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
W = 2 triangles how does that work

475
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
What school look at the example code

476
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
Conveniently we have the

477
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,311
Basically basing this author Melita because I do know that this application works so I can

478
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
One of the things I am looking sorry about this to get sizes that means there is no z-buffer with the cast

479
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Will worry about that later

480
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:00,255
Ok Josh if I wanted to spew some lines of the screen

481
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,095
I don't understand why shouldn't be allowed to spew some lines on the screen

482
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,703
Like I get that it's slow as molasses as it should be

483
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,775
Outline the got to go somewhere

484
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,079
I'm not having a buffer object

485
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,023
I guess you'll triangles tries count x 3

486
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,119
What's the number of vertices that sell pudding

487
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
So really

488
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,751
If I was going to do this it would be

489
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,567
But but

490
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:13,983
Are my friend just texted me asking me what I'm doing

491
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,383
Right now I'm trying to get this orange Pi the small $19 computer and a man

492
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,783
Try to get this thing to output video to the HTC vive

493
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
Possible theoretically

494
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:34,719
To have VR entirely in the headset so I won't have to have a long cable

495
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:40,351
Going all the way back to the wall and to the computer

496
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
I just did that thing

497
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:07,231
Saudi X1 so making the quad and so that's going to be

498
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:34,367
So that's going to be X1 y1

499
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
Over 2

500
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,999
X2 y1

501
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,399
And we got to be clockwise when arranging things

502
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Don't forget to go clockwise

503
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,111
Tell me read your guide stuff you've been saying a lot of stuff

504
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,559
Yeah it's really depressing

505
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:24,031
Yeah it's fine I'm just looking at the amount of bits you have to give to the the headset and it's just

506
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,431
It's just completely depressing so the next so 1234

507
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:36,831
So the next to sea would be x 1 y 2 which is that

508
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:43,231
And then the next ones we would do is X1 Y2 than x 2

509
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,303
Y1 and then x

510
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,703
2 y 20 123456789 10

511
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:59,103
Navan for the 12th and then for the colours we feel it in 12

512
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,503
34 123 45 x 6

513
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,135
Ok on wish that you had it had

514
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
The thing where you could

515
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
Vertically anyway

516
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:25,983
Neon pi is is OpenGL ES

517
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:30,591
Clicking like music on nobody's referring to

518
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
Are

519
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
The bandwidth is hard anyway so

520
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:46,719
The rectangle in X1 is transmitting polygons

521
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
Arbitrary polygons

522
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:58,239
Now drivers not intended for normal operation it is just intended for

523
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Bike

524
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
Right output but you can abuse rod ra2 output to open up a screen

525
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
To have the underline OpenGL OpenGL ES available to you so that way if you want to have it open to your window

526
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
Don't want to include or do all the window open yourself you can just use rather on

527
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,071
Just throwing it out there if you guys want to have some fun with it

528
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,519
Yes ggl size

529
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,295
Overflowed

530
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
The buffer

531
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,383
And I do have to subscribe to

532
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,479
Describe fewer is 2

533
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
The stride means the number of components per day died in Sofia right now just X and Y

534
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,927
So I'm selling it to till

535
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,351
Krd point

536
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,799
What is an early point I don't remember

537
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
So where is the thing for

538
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,879
Keep using shorts

539
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:50,527
Turn the frame didn't go copy and paste that from over here

540
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
Add

541
00:55:54,111 --> 00:56:00,255
How do I should figure out a clear with back cover

542
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
To do that

543
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
I lost my preview

544
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
At that right

545
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
Ice pack

546
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:28,159
I lost the the YouTube preview for heart secondary

547
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:36,095
Anyway so we're going to take polygons for going to clear frames in order to clear the frame programmed to be cleared

548
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:42,495
Where and declare possible clear colour

549
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,527
What's the hell VX driver does it

550
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,367
Clear frame

551
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:05,535
Foreground

552
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
We will use that too I guess

553
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:17,823
And sobr which is That Ends Well

554
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:33,439
X

555
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,535
That number

556
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
Turn down

557
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:47,775
55 times

558
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:52,383
Set a timer 65 that number

559
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,207
It's kind of wacky then for the next one cause you can't multiply that out because you'd lose bits of precision

560
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,815
Turn it down

561
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:19,775
24-bit down and then we can do 255 again

562
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,639
That should clear the frames now swapping bottles that should be fairly easy to

563
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
Offers

564
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:35,391
Ytl swap office what is a function for it

565
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:48,447
That's a good point Morpheus even the stupidest of compilers will do that

566
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,031
I don't know it's just force of habit I guess

567
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,127
Probably better I probably should have written it the other way

568
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:03,295
Anyway get dimensions

569
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,647
Do we already have screen with the height stored anywhere

570
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,767
Need a window handles that

571
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:17,119
Is an actual fine

572
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,503
Turn the light off

573
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:39,903
Ok

574
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:46,303
You had better already be in full screen mode

575
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,703
Candle import we don't have any input on the system so

576
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:59,103
Don't know what to do there so next thing we have to do that is set up the screen

577
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,663
How do we do that let's go over here unlock

578
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,295
Copy and paste this code

579
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,487
Xopendisplay Noel the Wi-Fi using X11 which were not be

580
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:21,375
I have still not been able to get the thing to start up an X11 window with video acceleration

581
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,703
Forget it

582
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:37,759
Tea here so next thing to display which should

583
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,783
Work

584
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,599
Theoretically

585
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,279
Probably want to do that

586
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,143
What's to all this stuff this looks good I like all the stuff

587
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,495
Looks like a really good stuff

588
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,031
Stop stop stop

589
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,895
Let's go copy on this wholesale

590
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,223
I am really starting to hope that

591
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,015
This is

592
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,575
Under a licence I'm allowed to use

593
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,743
Don't need to do anything else

594
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,591
Probably make sure I can actually with this code

595
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:47,647
Yes I can't live this code thank you Mr whoever you are

596
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:00,191
Ok so

597
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
That copied

598
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,591
Still want to

599
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:13,503
You still working on to do now is we're going to want to take

600
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:20,415
The the end here there is a thing worse x 11 for getting a fan switch

601
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
If we someday have X11 available to us which we got today

602
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
Whatever

603
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,895
Ok

604
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
I'm going to do now TV Jet2

605
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:53,695
It's my mum

606
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,279
Hey man I'm actually likes doing right now

612
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:47,711
Orange egl

613
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:17,919
Do not want to use rasterizer think that might actually do me

614
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,231
Ok

615
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,535
Off

616
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:45,055
Start digging through

617
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,999
Courier

618
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,095
With undeclared here

619
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:14,495
That would be fair because we don't yet know

620
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
How big this is going to be

621
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:29,087
What we do when we set up the screen or at least we know how big the user thinks it should be when we set up the screen

622
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:44,191
The next couple of Christmas

623
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:00,831
And what's going on here

624
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,231
Should be should be

625
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
No

626
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,935
What to do in wrong

627
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:20,543
Does anybody online see what's wrong here cos I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong

628
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,103
I think I can use GLS your

629
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,535
Wz grg

630
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:48,447
Says unexpected error expected identifier

631
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,263
Open France use before numeric constant

632
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:14,047
Service needs to be a un 16th

633
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:20,447
Thank you

634
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,287
You just took the problem

635
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:28,127
Next

636
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:46,303
Now there is one annoying thing about when your operating on an SD card is sometimes your data just disappears so I'm

637
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
You pushing a fair bit

638
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:51,935
Saving files as nothing when the the bringer of death comes

639
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:59,103
So24

640
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,639
Window

641
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,455
That's doing there

642
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:13,439
Next one is go shot

643
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,999
T0shirt

644
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,007
What time is ardee point I'm known

645
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
Have not done in food

646
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,191
Chat typecast

647
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,335
Harley Quinn

648
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:06,687
What type of fat is that in C

649
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,039
So that song

650
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,743
Yep just Corbridge is definitely working

651
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:23,839
And if you go over life survive

652
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,679
You can totally see

653
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,471
YouTube live chat

654
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,311
Can you can go read through it I did disable

655
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
Editing the things so so

656
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:43,807
If you really wanted to search it or go back through the chat history of any of the live streams you totally can now

657
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
Off

658
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,303
You didn't hear me I f*** you

659
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:02,239
It is not two-way

660
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,335
I did not want to patch it back to YouTube says YouTube is temporary

661
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:12,735
And discord is permanent if you want to chat just chat or not telling you to so next one

662
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:17,855
Repoint why is Ali point

663
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,671
Ok silver here

664
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:27,071
See what line was there I was on 227 and it says

665
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,911
And not why

666
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,735
Finisterre

667
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,951
Not have any good way of returning out of that land on it

668
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,495
It has a problem

669
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:12,127
I just crashed ok that's great

670
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
There is no way to fail

671
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
I don't like that

672
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:23,135
I'm going to make it so that CFG setup in fail

673
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:38,495
For all of seeing actually

674
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
Hi corn dog

675
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:04,095
Actually is anybody tried checking to make sure that they can't write in the discord chat Ark

676
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,983
Arm that seems like a thing that should have been tested that I never tested

677
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
Probably open the rest of drivers to make sure on break something

678
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:39,167
Who had all this jumper I have no idea how to return things in

679
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,983
Does anybody in there know

680
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,799
Objective-C

681
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,895
I have no idea how to

682
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,967
2R

683
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,015
Return a value

684
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,071
You can write into a live chat

685
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,375
So you can wait until I said that's right

686
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,471
How

687
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
Can you just return

688
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,319
Is anybody know live chat

689
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,927
Does anybody know Jack Dempsey

690
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:38,303
Return integer objective

691
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,543
No I want to return integer from a function

692
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:55,711
They have this function here which I guess it's a functional real wacky to me

693
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
Arm

694
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,039
How to return a value from it

695
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,855
No return

696
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,503
Yeah nice try you can

697
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:35,647
I'd like to see you try to make an apple desktop app in see a lot of people have tried

698
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
Succeeded

699
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:13,535
So the reason why Roswell was ported to Apple was because

700
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:20,703
Specifically I'm already in that file was specifically

701
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:25,311
4recent so that people could run see anything on a Mac

702
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,511
Isn't a language much like Python it's just a cold

703
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:10,111
Ok

704
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,511
Play Netflix with a lot of noses

705
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:22,911
293 g size

706
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,311
Ok where is EGR major come from

707
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:48,511
Undeclared income

708
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,511
So very strange year

709
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:58,911
So first

01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:05,311
Reporting this text Michael clearport Roger to the Orange pi

01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:11,711
Killer portlight survived and then form

712
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:37,311
Yes actually I don't have any way of flashing it near all in

713
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:43,711
Unless you can send me a link with like an actual guide is how they do it which would be kinda fun to do a live on air

714
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:50,111
So we could try it it's going to be at least two more times before two more livestreams before I

715
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:56,511
Get Ty going back to getting a whole bunch of my custom FDM tags

716
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:02,911
Ok so let's look try try try

717
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:09,311
I get my drawer

718
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:15,711
Include user include

719
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:22,111
EGR EGR the HR

720
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:28,511
Dpy config native window type

721
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:34,911
What is that

722
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:13,567
Avoid star

723
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,472
Punks

724
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
That's not right

725
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,616
Unix isn't only X11

726
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,968
Ignore it for right now

727
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,280
Whatever happened in North right now

728
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
Ugly

729
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,128
We can do we can forcibly

730
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,936
TV

731
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:19,008
Hello weird

732
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,464
Sure let's just used Dad

733
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,008
Vertex shader source not found

734
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,384
Default

735
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:36,320
Things same things probably happened for pregnant

736
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Thesaurus

737
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,440

738
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,768
Rat

739
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,808
That's an easy fix

740
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,304
Capital Mali

741
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:30,080
Yes that's all secret

742
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:46,720
Snakes reproduce the fire

743
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,280
39 KB

744
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,328
Made a file

745
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,944
Yes we're on it

746
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,504
Everybody's waiting for me to run in Marseille

747
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:21,024
Yeah I couldn't get the GPU working with sorry services who wants me to run

748
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,584
Where is ITV guys hanging

749
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,448
Who sings is going to crash

750
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:35,360
We are either going to crash before does anything

751
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:41,760
Cos like it won't link Wray it's going to crash want to talk to making calls to OpenGL

752
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:48,160
Or it's going to start crashing as soon as he tries to understand the screen is not going to crash but nothing's going to come out of the van

753
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
What are you guys thinking

754
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
Using a crash were you guys thinking of crash

755
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,144
Before does anything

756
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,824
Ok I think that's a reasonable thing so it's probably going to crash when it starts the Open

757
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
As driver

758
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,712
And honestly I haven't tried running the ogs toughest boot

759
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:18,112
I'm order crash up that's a good point if it crashes the colonel that's going to be hilarious

760
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
Ok

761
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:28,864
Ready like my heart actually kind of breathing fast right now

762
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,824
Adam gave me the fire extinguisher could you go

763
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,664
Heatsinks under stairs and apply 12V on pi

764
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,784
Yeah you're right here

765
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:53,184
Have I ever radio purchased

766
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,976
Looks like maybe the problem is

767
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,280
Well

768
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:03,680
Where is there's no gdst

769
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,616
Cancel

770
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
Pulling out all the time

771
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:21,600
Yeah

772
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:28,000
Adam is now applying Keepsafe to the

773
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:53,600
I don't think so I don't think that was the one that got hot

774
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:58,464
Imagine that only if someone is the main one is for the GP will tell so

775
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,792
Memory warm but not hot

776
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:08,192
That supposed to be heating

777
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Play Holdem

778
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:12,288
Do you wanna show the camera

779
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:16,896
Nice things about the surface area and then there's just a flat thing which

780
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,712
Seems like it would do virtually nothing

781
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:26,112
Most heatsinks always worry me

782
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:32,768
Yeah they do seem dubious xochi pensions

783
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:38,400
Which is way for that I would have expected you to garden

784
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,360
What's this for

785
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
Will the shops

786
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,064
Yeah we put this on Mia

787
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,856
Anyway

788
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:04,512
Ok this code got wait for another night

789
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:10,656
Piece of sorry only this half of the cameras visible this is an orange Pi PC

790
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,496
As opposed to this one which is an arm for orange Pi one

791
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:20,128
Find ktc Hazel

792
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,712
For something else is used for

793
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:29,600
Yeah that's fine pipeeasy is identical to the Raspberry Pi

794
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:37,024
It is not identical but has completely different

795
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,560
Physical

796
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:44,960
I appreciate that actually instead of a stupid micro USB

797
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:51,360
Actually you know what they're all now this is the wrong one somewhere I have a girl

798
01:29:54,176 --> 01:30:00,320
Play so it's actually getting all the way through set up in scratch and some

799
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,648
Pause

800
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:07,744
Tvd guys

801
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:19,008
No orange Pi uses of very different shape

802
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,080
If you use the same ship we wouldn't be able to use it for this

803
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:48,960
Pixel

804
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,544
Pixel

805
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:06,112
Oh hey look at that

806
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,904
Set off

807
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:16,096
Yeah I know it's not the right resolution by default so

808
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,856
It is utterly broken

809
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,648
It is

810
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
Completely

811
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
Broken

812
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:29,568
That is not even remotely right

813
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,152
Ok

814
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,344
Time for us to start the debugging

815
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,416
Ok hello

816
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,048
Is the first part we have to do

817
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,936
Change one thing deep within our

818
01:32:56,192 --> 01:33:00,544
10-ft function stop

819
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,736
Somewhere run

820
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,888
Yeah it's pretty bad right now got to figure out what's actually going on

821
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:30,752
Is 27 frames per second of nothingness so

822
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:20,416
Cancel audio is just to their

823
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,280
Trying to get something working

824
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:44,736
1000 1000

825
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,528
2000

826
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,880
To see what happens

827
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:09,824
Well it's

828
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,920
Big blue screen

829
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:20,064
Solis clear colours working

830
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:33,120
Check to see what

831
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,192
How are you know what

832
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,800
About one's numbers that are much smaller

833
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,944
Seymours play this 5.0 wine

834
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,552
See what happens

835
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,616
Turn it around some like shapes

836
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:36,864
If there's something I need to see and chat let me know it cos right now I don't

837
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,424
Don't intend to follow you guys for the next couple of minutes

838
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:45,824
Girls into the strange world

839
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:44,192
Nothing nothing at all

840
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,520
What's going on here

841
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:53,152
Cell

842
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:57,504
Going to have to get this going

843
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:16,192
OK Google what what's right now for children clothes

844
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,752
Floats down

845
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:51,424
I think

846
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:10,624
Come on

847
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:17,024
Smart working

848
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:36,224
Ok

849
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,624
Let's just prior rendering a triangle with the Melly test

850
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:55,424
Also I just realized I'm an idiot

851
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:21,024
Hitman display so you can go outside without the optics

852
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:27,424
You can I believe remove those lenses but you also have those prototype head not displays that

853
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:33,824
If you want to go check that would be super awesome

854
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:40,224
Downstairs under the next song

855
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,624
Blue screen

856
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:18,624
Listen

857
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:25,024
How does that not work

858
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:37,824
No it's just that it's just wonderful just just

859
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:50,624
Getting cold

860
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:16,224
Ok thank you

861
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:22,624
Are you serious

862
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:29,024
You can probably pull the active site of that one just as easily I would much rather not not after seeing this

863
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:35,424
Here's one that doesn't have the whole thing

864
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:41,824
Can you get another

865
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:48,224
No I don't but I would need somewhere powering it

866
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,904
Valve send me prototype head units so this is one of the perfect iPad units that will be

867
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,952
Will a call to have set up

868
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:03,840
Yes that's a really good idea atom

869
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,568
That song gets tied to you guys

870
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,040
Ok so right now I'm able to actually get something on the screen

871
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:28,416
What's called back to what we had before

872
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,960
Private and see what happens

873
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:49,408
There is nothing

874
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:06,816
Nothing

875
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:18,336
Who's the powered by

876
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,664
Small barrel connector

877
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,296
Actually that's used

878
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:34,208
Do you want to pull that out of there yeah we can do that

879
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:40,608
Cos you're wanting you didn't seem to give us it all that without feeling like an unexploded it

880
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:57,504
That's why it's not rendering that's a degenerate triangle how did it get to

881
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:03,904
Triangle triangle

882
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:10,304
Is Mr Strong

883
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,128
Do you want to keep it so that we can plug into this fairly easily

884
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:34,368
In case the damn thing doesn't work at all

885
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:38,208
Stop

886
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:45,120
Hey ok maybe it's about putting something right now

887
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:57,920
Power down

888
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:04,320
I see light there's something in the corner to see if you have it

889
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:09,440
Message

890
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:14,304
Are you random into Dad apdl

891
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,840
Hey

892
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:22,240
That's really Jackie though the camera so yeah it's

893
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:26,336
Hard to see but it's like a bunch of noise

894
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:38,880
Ok so we got to figure out this year I will try to figure out

895
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,280
Why this is not working it just black now

896
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:58,336
Anything right now

897
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:11,136
I'm actually probably going to go to slightly different Direction with the next thing with Steam

898
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:17,536
Then I think that they are going to go

899
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:43,136
What's good to me what's wrong with it artificial

900
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:55,936
Where is Genki

901
01:48:56,192 --> 01:49:02,336
Give Adam a moment to see

902
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:08,736
Fixes doing anything

903
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:15,136
Dad but yeah yeah blue

904
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:21,536
Ok because I had no idea I thought that was

905
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:27,936
Not a screen I had no idea

906
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:34,336
Turn down funny screen texture

907
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:40,736
Yeah it was like Grey black

908
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:47,136
Really pretty though anyway

909
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,744
Displaying anything

910
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:02,240
I'm not having the party

911
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:08,640
Black totally black

912
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:20,928
Not right now thank you

913
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:29,632
Ok check that out

914
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:36,032
There is a triangle inside the five for making progress here

915
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:42,432
Adam heating somebody to hold this up here while

916
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:51,904
Tending to be ok

917
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,208
Let's go to stack of chairs

918
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,536
We do have the chair stack

919
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:05,728
If you want to build something ridiculous right near me

920
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,264
Freeze dried soup

921
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:15,712
No it was Nicky smell it was 25fps when it's doing the default test which is

922
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:19,296
Intensive of things better didn't Crumlin

923
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:37,984
I I will do that but not right now I want to get our kind of working first

924
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,824
Looks like to see

925
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,128
Why would a

926
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,968
What's what's take A Peek inside of the Colour buffer

927
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:53,600
Unsigned by for stride

928
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:55,392
4

929
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:12,800
No you have it can you be looking

930
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:19,200
The background on the matter what it's broken right now definitely wrong

931
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:25,600
Skyline

932
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:38,400
Stop cast

933
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:44,800
Turn off the lights

934
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:56,576
Horrifying

935
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:02,976
Crashing ok sorry about that

936
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:09,376
Oh that's not a bad idea

937
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:11,936
Difficulty

938
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:16,800
Meant to be clearly visible

939
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:23,200
Very dark compared to the outside

940
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:29,600
Is the display 0 years by it but it's all

941
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:36,000
Doing the stripy thing the rolling shutter

942
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:42,400
Song because I can manually can control the exposure Times online

943
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:48,800
I might w Jack so on the IP camera

944
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:55,200
Media image

945
01:53:55,456 --> 01:54:01,600
No no

946
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:08,000
Set timer

947
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:33,600
I don't see it

948
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:40,000
It looks janky

949
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:46,400
30/60 it's still look pretty rough

950
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:52,800
Because it's only open for a very short period of time

951
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:59,200
Ok so this is clearly wrong it's passing FF 00000000

952
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:05,600
Cheers just playing Black why is it passing black

953
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:12,000
Webcam cannot do it you have to go

954
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:18,400
Before you can do that and I don't want to be a serious because there is enough x

955
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:24,800
White bits white you have a triangle look at that guys

956
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,080
Ok

957
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:34,528
How is going ok where are or are making inroads here

958
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:42,464
Hair erase

959
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:07,296
More useful Charles

960
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,344
Is there anyway good too

961
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:14,976
Now that's probably fine

962
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:20,864
Video message please

963
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:32,384
I can maybe we can see is there anything going on the centre

964
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,712
No nothing is going on the centre

965
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:42,624
Actually let's take a peek back individual buffer

966
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:49,024
12

967
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:08,992
Is there anything visible on the centre on

968
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:15,392
Look like now

969
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:21,792
I don't actually know it OpenGL does with

970
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:28,192
That's the wrong thing I bet you people were

971
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:34,592
Writing in chat

972
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:53,792
Turn the heater inside the shader

973
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:29,376
Hey ok we have a triangle again

974
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,752
Is it worth doing janky stuff to make that work

975
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:47,552
Security a good way of getting quite

976
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:53,952
If you really need to see I'm done

977
01:58:54,208 --> 01:59:00,352
No more need to until 2 minutes from now

978
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:03,936
Sideways

979
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:04,704
Something

980
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,984
Saying thanks bye

981
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,776
Put your screen is cut off

982
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:44,896
KFC off the right side

983
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,880
I like somebody wanted to know what was going on like going line

984
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:01,792
Anyway

985
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:58,112
Tell anybody else to have a use uniforms Josh if you're still watching you probably know better than ideal

986
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,224
Did something go wrong with the

987
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:42,144
Oh no

988
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:50,080
Are you looks like a prototype is to display panels Adam did you happen to notice of the display

989
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:55,200
The prototype was to display kennels

990
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,528
He says it's just one piano

991
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:02,880
Ok so

992
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:29,504
Yeah I know I understand what uniforms are I just don't have it use them on

993
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,320
On this platform

994
02:02:54,336 --> 02:03:00,480
Let's see this person is done it how you look go uniform it's a thing

995
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:19,168
After the program links you would call

996
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:29,408
Security uniform shader program

997
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:33,248
Recalling the

998
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:42,976
Screen scale

999
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:16,256
What's 4 in here we kinda now

1000
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:22,656
I'm so going to try to do is try to scale the object by x&y appropriately

1001
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:35,456
And I'll show the FPS in a minute imagine that the FPS 90 FPS

1002
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:37,760
Only driving a single triangle

1003
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:48,000
See hear

1004
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:56,704
Play so will I by width and height

1005
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:59,520
Ok

1006
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:07,200
And would actually be saying /

1007
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:10,784
So we have like 500

1008
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:18,464
Will want to say for 0.0 is your point

1009
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:22,048
930

1010
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:27,168
Position a

1011
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:33,312
X

1012
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,640
Scale

1013
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,456
Let's be

1014
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:42,272
Chill

1015
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:55,328
Electronic if you want to do that I have a source code for Rod supports esp32 another

1016
02:05:55,584 --> 02:06:01,728
The things so it does let you do matrices on Mike really lame hardware and princess on the

1017
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:07,360
8266 works there is no floating point so it's all using like

1018
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:14,528
Movie Lee basic operations if you want to see how I do it then there was the wireframe example with

1019
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:23,232
Ok

1020
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,888
Maybe the sort now

1021
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:04,192
Nothing there is a reason why that could be

1022
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:12,896
One of those reasons will be there

1023
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:40,288
What's try rendering really dig

1024
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:48,224
50/50 and over and

1025
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:01,792
So you need shaders because you aren't allowed there's no fix functionality pipeline in in

1026
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:08,192
Move down there like yeah we're just going to rehearse Elves and triangles without tutors

1027
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:14,592
Flippantly but I guess it was nice because now all hard work has to support shooters

1028
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:19,200
If you want to be OpenGL yes but I don't know

1029
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:30,976
Hey there is a little

1030
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,792
You guys can see that in the upper corner

1031
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:35,584
Tiny little

1032
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:37,120
Do Dad

1033
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:46,080
So let's try blowing up song 500/500

1034
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:51,712
See that looks like the top corner of a triangle

1035
02:08:54,272 --> 02:09:00,416
That looks super wrong

1036
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:03,232
Really wrong

1037
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:09,632
That means there year

1038
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:11,424
Turn on

1039
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,032
I guess we just shouldn't be having things at the screen edges

1040
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:22,688
And the other thing is going on here is the way that works is 00 is at the bar

1041
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:29,088
Turn on bottom corner right here and that's not where it is

1042
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:35,488
Anything like graphics we're on graphics it goes way up at the top that would be easier as your own so I guess

1043
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:37,536
Adjusted so that

1044
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:40,096
I can handle all that in this year

1045
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:48,800
Pudsey here I'm going to have my tutor and then you

1046
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,080
Lip

1047
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:54,176
I think it is

1048
02:09:54,688 --> 02:10:00,832
3 - 2 and then that would be plus 1

1049
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:07,232
I think that's gonna look at around so that the triangle show up in the top corner perfect it did

1050
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:13,632
That's good insane now

1051
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:39,232
Something else now

1052
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:52,032
What's 2160 / 2 as 1080

1053
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:04,832
1205 8 to the 600

1054
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:11,232
That looks like I should be in the middle

1055
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:17,632
It is yeah we have a triangle

1056
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:24,032
Ok

1057
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:30,432
What's the term in framerate

1058
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:49,632
9.5 FPS which is exactly what it should be so we are getting

1059
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:56,032
90fps out of the system right now that's perfect

1060
02:11:56,288 --> 02:12:02,432
Ok next one let's try drawing some wines

1061
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:15,232
Gorgeous

1062
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:28,032
Excellent that is the way I want to see things working

1063
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:34,432
Ok so what that means is now we have a odgl driver

1064
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:40,832
4 Raja which is one of the big things we wanted to college today so I'd say where

1065
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:47,232
Cruising along pretty good just double-check some things like one thing

1066
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:53,632
New right now is re-enable this junk and see what happens

1067
02:12:53,888 --> 02:13:00,032
On the other thing I want to do is get rid of

1068
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:19,232
It's not quite right

1069
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:32,032
Actually painfully slow but I can't see in FPS

1070
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:44,832
Turn the lights as well

1071
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:16,832
I'm going to have to go over there and take a look and tea

1072
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:42,432
Something's definitely

1073
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:48,832
I don't really know what's going on I could be like a CPU I don't want to

1074
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:55,232
It could be something like maybe I'm switching dramos really quickly

1075
02:14:55,488 --> 02:15:01,632
So all I can do is every single frame I can print

1076
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:08,032
And then what I can do is inside of the

1077
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:14,432
Here every single time I would draw a new settee geometry I can

1078
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:19,808
Like the lights nation point and I can know how many different types of

1079
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:22,880
Oh my

1080
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:27,488
Oh my god that is a lot of draw calls

1081
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:33,120
That's concerning the bigger they I wonder

1082
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:48,224
Hello there tiny why are there all these tiny rock holes

1083
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:17,920
Also Sue

1084
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:23,552
Busted

1085
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:33,792
Why would we not getting 90 FPS

1086
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:42,752
Yeah so you just can't intermix segments and pixels in the same thing

1087
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:49,664
But I don't understand is so I guess what you guys can't see

1088
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:56,064
There's almost nothing you

1089
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:02,464
Can you do some get a glimpse of the the little piece of geometry but it's almost never there so

1090
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:08,864
Not really sure what's going on

1091
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,936
Turn black back on a blue background see you never going to see it

1092
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:14,240
Make the background much darker

1093
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:26,016
I forgotten how to make a background darker

1094
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,856
Where is the

1095
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,464
This

1096
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:44,704
So now I'm here

1097
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:51,104
See like a little bit of red just Barrett

1098
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:57,504
Invisible so it's like it's only the very first and very last bit of the geometry

1099
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,320
Play bits of the geometry they're actually being rendered

1100
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:04,672
Natural why that is we should totally figure that out

1101
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,720
So

1102
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:11,584
Clothes

1103
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:31,040
I was only drawing one thing that's why

1104
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:50,496
Completely plastered

1105
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:53,568
118 APS

1106
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:57,664
Samsung trolley broke

1107
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:02,784
What about day

1108
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:15,072
What's

1109
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:17,120
5 x 3

1110
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:51,936
Nothing

1111
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:28,288
Vertex attrib pointer how's this thing used

1112
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:31,104
Potassium 3

1113
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:35,200
Alice the number of vertices

1114
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:40,064
Number of colors

1115
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,928
No it's the stride it's only the stride rate

1116
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,584
So maybe that

1117
02:20:56,448 --> 02:21:01,312
I'm getting the same basic stuff again

1118
02:21:22,048 --> 02:21:24,864
Could be doing something wrong here

1119
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:29,984
Make sure not clearing through multiple times

1120
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:47,392
Oh you know what quarries

1121
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:04,800
Calories has that function used

1122
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,624
Set an alarm tonight probably why should be doing

1123
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,536
Not home stride

1124
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:35,008
What's NI

1125
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:48,064
Buy there is definitely a problem something with the speed of this is really slow

1126
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:24,928
Can't imagine printer office what's slowing it down

1127
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:44,128
Alaska I will stop printing and see how that does

1128
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:56,416
We want to also cancel the

1129
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:21,760
I'm swapping buffers twice

1130
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:24,064
That would do it

1131
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:32,512
Oh hey it's gorgeous now

1132
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:38,912
Oh yeah

1133
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:51,712
Decorate a hole in it for some reason not sure if that's about but

1134
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:57,600
Yeah

1135
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:07,328
I was swapping offers twice in the the same like swapping in swipe

1136
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:12,704
Stopping at back which is just a recipe for all sorts of failure

1137
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,544
Cecil that's those

1138
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:21,152
Should we all see the texts that should be being wrong

1139
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:26,016
I'm gonna come out and see what happens with changes

1140
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:49,568
See any text anywhere on screen that should appear there

1141
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:57,760
Oh meat

1142
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:04,160
All you guys

1143
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:10,560
Let me go

1144
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:16,960
Online 111

1145
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:29,760
Why is that

1146
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:36,160
My colour

1147
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:42,560
You know why

1148
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:48,960
Life doesn't do that I think it does

1149
02:26:55,616 --> 02:27:01,760
The dialogue colour whatever

1150
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:14,560
Yes the spies rendering this

1151
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:33,760
Rip headphone users

1152
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:40,160
I'm sorry I have no idea

1153
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:46,560
This rate you guys can see what's going on connected to the Orange pi

1154
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:52,960
Right there through the HDMI plug

1155
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:59,360
What do you mean like taking it out of the house

1156
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:01,664
That's silly Adam

1157
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:04,736
That's just silly

1158
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:16,512
I guess I could put it back there I couldn't see the things on the

1159
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:18,560
Before but I can't now so

1160
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:23,424
I hope that's ok I just have a huge

1161
02:28:57,728 --> 02:28:59,520
Hi Amazon

1162
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:24,608
Work so hard

1163
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:31,008
Play displaying keep broad right as it is it's because there is no available with video acceleration

1164
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:35,104
I want to be able to have a very xvideo accelerated output

1165
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,688
Ok that's so much better

1166
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:13,248
That pretty good

1167
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:19,648
Surrey now that little area in the top corner should turn greyish

1168
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:22,208
Richard end

1169
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,488
Just to spite me

1170
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:38,336
Nope still in Accra

1171
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:08,032
I think would be very cool somebody reported virtual boy over to this

1172
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,344
Maybe it's actually just that dark

1173
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,000
I just can't see it

1174
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:37,984
Yeah that's what's going on

1175
02:31:58,208 --> 02:32:04,352
Blue going on

1176
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:51,712
What does refrain do that could be breaking it rain

1177
02:32:58,368 --> 02:33:04,512
Just comment out of bath

1178
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:07,328
Graphics programming can sometimes Go

1179
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:13,728
Ok why is this not behaving the way over expected to then

1180
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:18,848
01

1181
02:33:19,104 --> 02:33:25,248
How is Rob Oxo

1182
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:27,296
How are called does play into it

1183
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:35,904
Why would the colours be boosted so heavily

1184
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:52,800
And last

1185
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:59,200
You know why it could be little endian

1186
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:12,000
Began dry Indian

1187
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:18,400
Most significant bye

1188
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:24,800
No that's not the case but

1189
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:50,400
There is a function somewhere here is

1190
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:56,800
Set the colour of pasta

1191
02:35:57,056 --> 02:36:03,200
Crgv up

1192
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:22,400
I'm just walking around

1193
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:35,200
No that was my great ok let's try fix guys

1194
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:48,000
So you know why

1195
02:36:48,256 --> 02:36:54,400
There's a thing you can do and it's

1196
02:36:54,656 --> 02:37:00,800
OpenGL I think it's with this

1197
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:07,200
It's

1198
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:13,600
Sing about this knows that the new viapro the old one first

1199
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:20,000
Normal eyes

1200
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:26,400
What's right setting like to true

1201
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:32,800
So right now I'm sitting red to be 1 out of 255

1202
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:39,200
So should be nowhere near as Bray

1203
02:37:39,456 --> 02:37:45,600
Perfect ha

1204
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:52,000
Ok so now

1205
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:58,400
Undo everything here here

1206
02:37:58,656 --> 02:38:04,800
Set the back to GL horse

1207
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:24,000
I lost my video stream

1208
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:36,800
Ok I show you there's something on the display we just have to figure out why the

1209
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:43,200
Radio 1

1210
02:38:43,456 --> 02:38:49,600
Hey there we go

1211
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:56,000
What's even weirder what's going on it's like

1212
02:38:56,256 --> 02:39:02,400
Call Jackie

1213
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:08,800
I would not be amazed if they hacked it

1214
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:15,200
Wow what's going on I can see here

1215
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:40,800
Volume again I guess I have to

1216
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:53,600
Well

1217
02:40:19,456 --> 02:40:25,600
No it's still host it's just lost the ability to sell

1218
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:32,000
Rtsp streams

1219
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:44,800
Very strange

1220
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:51,200
How I guess we could just watch it in a stone

1221
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:57,600
Or something

1222
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:10,400
No it's a wired camera

1223
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:16,800
Re9 viewing in the web browser so to using an mjpeg stream

1224
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:29,600
Whoops

1225
02:41:55,456 --> 02:42:01,600
The full width

1226
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:08,000
It's working now so I have a functional

1227
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:14,400
OMD the red area actually has texted you to it ok

1228
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:20,800
What song what do a wee bit of a stress test

1229
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:27,200
Without doing any kind of clever optimizations let's see what happens if we try to render a

1230
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:33,600
One More Line s

1231
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:45,376
Still able to keep up

1232
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:51,776
Critters in the background there

1233
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:54,848
Turn up to over 10000

1234
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:05,344
That it's not able to do

1235
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:17,632
Yes I did unfortunately it's going to be a pain getting that all the upstream stuff

1236
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:24,032
Because they don't seem to be taking very

1237
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:30,432
Play to me and I don't really understand how to get Lanark to club patches for me so

1238
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:37,088
Yeah

1239
02:43:37,344 --> 02:43:43,488
Looks like actually 9000 is probably about the most but I'm gonna bump back down to eat right now concepts

1240
02:43:43,744 --> 02:43:46,560
Plenty enough for the kind of things I Wanna Do

1241
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:55,008
Ok now what I want to do is I want to see if I

1242
02:43:55,264 --> 02:44:01,408
Turn the change the line width but see how you do that

1243
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:07,808
Vs change line width

1244
02:44:08,064 --> 02:44:14,208
OpenGL ES is that like actually offend

1245
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:36,480
Aldi Darwen

1246
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:42,880
I'm emailing to make sure that's actually

1247
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:49,280
I can't really tell

1248
02:44:55,936 --> 02:45:01,056
Try not see what happens

1249
02:45:03,104 --> 02:45:09,248
I still am I going dumb

1250
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:11,296
Really tell

1251
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:24,864
Oh yeah it's definitely they're all look at those wide Lines

1252
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:31,264
Look at that

1253
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:44,064
Oh my gosh survival keeping up to

1254
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:50,464
That's great

1255
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:56,864
Let's see what happens if we are

1256
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:03,264
Things I can try to do the tweak the output see if those speed it up and all

1257
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:41,919
No there is just an upper limit on how many lines the

1258
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:48,319
You can draw looks like

1259
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:54,719
Answer right now or somewhere between about 70 and 85 FPS so what I can do as I can try

1260
02:46:54,975 --> 02:47:01,119
Turning on deaf testing and we'll see if that helps

1261
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:07,519
2416 is all we really need

1262
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:18,783
Pressing suit about the same speed even with z-depth stuff

1263
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:35,679
OGL enable

1264
02:47:37,471 --> 02:47:41,311
Neighbours cast

1265
02:47:41,567 --> 02:47:43,871
Right

1266
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:55,903
An example Example

1267
02:47:56,671 --> 02:47:59,999
Is fine example I want to copy and paste something I don't have to think

1268
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:18,175
Does anybody have any really quick OpenGL code for Harding like quickly do dips stuff

1269
02:48:19,199 --> 02:48:21,759
Why did I click on a direct3d 9 link

1270
02:48:47,103 --> 02:48:52,991
I just realised this isn't going to be able to be testable with Rod rockers rod rod doesn't had a deal with z

1271
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:55,295
So it's pointless

1272
02:48:57,087 --> 02:48:59,903
I guess I just wanted to see but

1273
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:30,879
Please don't slow down please don't slow down please don't slow down please don't say oh my gosh

1274
02:49:31,135 --> 02:49:37,279
Wait a minute it's not slowing down and it's clearly working

1275
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:43,679
Testing completely broken but

1276
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:50,079
That's a really good sign that means we can use death testing if you're really

1277
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:56,479
Ok I think 4 time for do for a break

1278
02:49:56,735 --> 02:50:02,879
Back at 7

1279
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:09,279
P.m. to do is commit stuff

1280
02:50:12,607 --> 02:50:14,911
I'm going to go back abroad

1281
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:36,927
Make sure it doesn't explode

1282
02:50:39,487 --> 02:50:45,631
Goodnight ok

1283
02:50:45,887 --> 02:50:52,031
Is working just fine up there and everything's fine I guess I should not

1284
02:50:52,287 --> 02:50:58,431
Do you dab

1285
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:29,151
It's really cool that you can have

1286
02:51:29,407 --> 02:51:35,551
I didn't know you could set up screens in the castle that were not full screen

1287
02:52:12,671 --> 02:52:18,815
Yeah we need to fix that

1288
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:25,215
It's killing the framerate because it's switching between arm

1289
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:31,615
Pixels and segments so dramatically

1290
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:58,815
Brendan

1291
02:54:59,071 --> 02:55:05,215
Mirrors at mine

1292
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:43,615
Play I in Chard

1293
02:55:43,871 --> 02:55:50,015
Can somebody in Shotton work the time of the

1294
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:56,415
Like when everything came together so I can use it for a coming together or something else

1295
02:55:56,671 --> 02:56:02,815
Something's wrong with this not running it

1296
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:09,215
Speed

1297
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:41,215
What is this thing doing

1298
02:56:47,871 --> 02:56:54,015
Confront the powers of quietly practically

1299
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:19,615
Did you want to make something for dinner

1300
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:38,815
Ok

1301
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:10,815
You know what movie I want

1302
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:30,015
I know it's only 2

1303
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:36,415
GPU or PC PSU it's this thing right here which is really

1304
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:42,815
Smart grinder litepower right now

1305
02:58:43,071 --> 02:58:49,215
Do you know why it's only drawing like a couple milli

1306
02:58:55,871 --> 02:59:02,015
Hideous waiting

1307
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:08,415
What happens if you let it go as fast as I can

1308
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:14,815
Marius just fine

1309
03:00:11,647 --> 03:00:12,927
Thank you Jamie

1310
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:41,599

You guys seeing it

1312
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:32,799
OK actually I should do

1313
03:01:33,055 --> 03:01:39,199
To worry about that again

1314
03:02:43,455 --> 03:02:49,599
49 no

1315
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:55,999
Cheese gluten free

1316
03:02:56,255 --> 03:03:02,399
Alternative combined the white shells and cheddar

1317
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:08,799
No that's even worse

1318
03:03:15,455 --> 03:03:21,599
Make just one

1319
03:03:21,855 --> 03:03:27,999
Ok

1320
03:03:34,655 --> 03:03:40,799
Oh so there is

1321
03:03:41,055 --> 03:03:47,199
Turn off the fan in the video the video is behind the sound for the fan

1322
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:53,599
So you probably would hear our him Mark my order fast food to our house

1323
03:03:53,855 --> 03:03:59,999
Do we do we want him to do that

1324
03:04:00,255 --> 03:04:06,399
Ok Haymarket London

1325
03:04:06,655 --> 03:04:12,799
Lighting are you seeing that we the orange pi is actually working with the van everything

1326
03:04:13,055 --> 03:04:19,199
Actually not we can do

1327
03:04:19,455 --> 03:04:25,599
Diamond port life survive there is

1328
03:04:25,855 --> 03:04:31,999
Number to anymore stop

1329
03:04:40,703 --> 03:04:46,847
Another box of Ono I don't want the gluten-free I was just curious

1330
03:04:47,103 --> 03:04:53,247
Like I bought two boxes I only everyone also Dylan ever comes over I'll do it for him

1331
03:04:53,503 --> 03:04:54,015
Get it

1332
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:56,063
Did taste pretty rough

1333
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:58,111
I feel very sad for Dylan

1334
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:11,935
Ok

1335
03:05:13,727 --> 03:05:15,263
I think you're good

1336
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:21,919
Mayo for the second part of this which is the

1337
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:28,319
Bury park to me right now

1338
03:05:28,575 --> 03:05:30,111
You guys wanna Morgan chat

1339
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:39,839
So here's the second part the second part is

1340
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:46,239
Lights to 52 the orange Pi the original plan was for white survive to only

1341
03:05:46,495 --> 03:05:52,639
Require a minimal set of libraries that's making a very easy to Port to anything unfortunately

1342
03:05:52,895 --> 03:05:59,039
Justin Berger thank you very much for all of the work you've done you have made this love

1343
03:05:59,295 --> 03:06:05,439
So we'll see if it's harder or if it's really not that hard I have my opinions

1344
03:06:05,695 --> 03:06:11,839
What's find out

1345
03:06:26,943 --> 03:06:33,087
I forgot I also have to remove the extra copy of linux

1346
03:07:07,647 --> 03:07:11,743
Selma install the extra packages that are needed to make the Sling run

1347
03:07:13,791 --> 03:07:15,839
That's not that bad

1348
03:07:16,095 --> 03:07:19,167
76 MB isn't that bad

1349
03:07:21,727 --> 03:07:25,823
I was preparing for that number to be with bigger

1350
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:40,159
Esp32

1351
03:07:40,415 --> 03:07:46,559
Probably fine

1352
03:08:00,895 --> 03:08:06,783
There anyway

1353
03:08:07,039 --> 03:08:13,183
Can you help me Adam

1354
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:19,583
Got myself in a pickle

1355
03:08:19,839 --> 03:08:25,983
Get a real stand for desk

1356
03:08:26,751 --> 03:08:32,895
Hey Mark and Dylan if you guys want you could actually attach the live chat back up

1357
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:39,295
Your help and then we can be controlling things by live chat at your house and I could stream or webcam

1358
03:08:39,551 --> 03:08:45,695
Your house to here

1359
03:08:47,999 --> 03:08:54,143
So I'm right now going to try this on the experiment

1360
03:08:54,399 --> 03:09:00,543
Actually I should do we have the experimental vibe has

1361
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:01,311
Again

1362
03:09:03,615 --> 03:09:09,759
So

1363
03:09:10,015 --> 03:09:15,391
Live survive what's the running and see what happens

1364
03:09:32,543 --> 03:09:38,687
Wow no it is not going

1365
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:45,087
Turn off the old developmental for hardware

1366
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:51,487
No no

1367
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:53,791
Log into my computer I'm trying to run on my computer

1368
03:09:54,047 --> 03:10:00,191
I don't know no

1369
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:01,983
No it doesn't work

1370
03:10:02,495 --> 03:10:08,639
Volume to my desktop and I don't know which of these USB ports to use

1371
03:10:14,527 --> 03:10:19,647
Check

1372
03:10:19,903 --> 03:10:23,231
No it's definitely had it in the right one

1373
03:10:35,775 --> 03:10:37,311
Brown sugar

1374
03:11:05,983 --> 03:11:12,127
New Viber is working just fine with the video output from the orange pi

1375
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:24,927
Hey also one more thing if you guys are up for it if you go into discord

1376
03:11:25,183 --> 03:11:31,327
And if you like you guys to do if you're if you're up for it would be going to

1377
03:11:31,583 --> 03:11:32,351
Off-topic

1378
03:11:32,863 --> 03:11:39,007
And tell me what things about the stream you like in what things you didn't like or things that I can improve

1379
03:11:39,263 --> 03:11:42,079
Would like to try to up my YouTube streaming game in the future

1380
03:11:44,383 --> 03:11:50,527
Also really pretty good

1381
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:57,695
What would happen the people hate it so much ok

1382
03:11:58,207 --> 03:12:04,351
So actually I just didn't should I pull on my

1383
03:12:04,607 --> 03:12:09,983
Last I don't even care about my desktop I'm going to go plug in the arm pie

1384
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:45,567
Unplug the vibe

1385
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:50,943
Stop the White House

1386
03:13:07,583 --> 03:13:12,191
So now

1387
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:17,311
How to get a copy of web socket be on here as well

1388
03:13:18,591 --> 03:13:21,919
Websocket

1389
03:13:44,703 --> 03:13:48,543
Cardiff city website

1390
03:13:54,943 --> 03:13:59,551
Oh no they're trying to download go

1391
03:13:59,807 --> 03:14:02,111
4 X86 64

1392
03:14:02,623 --> 03:14:03,903
R32

1393
03:14:04,927 --> 03:14:06,207
That's not gonna work

1394
03:14:09,791 --> 03:14:14,655
Stolen websocket Dion arm

1395
03:14:22,847 --> 03:14:28,735
Ok I guess we'll just do this that look scary and

1396
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:37,695
I really don't know how I feel about just running a

1397
03:14:39,743 --> 03:14:41,791
Binary from someone

1398
03:14:43,583 --> 03:14:44,607
Hey

1399
03:14:44,863 --> 03:14:49,471
This game

1400
03:14:49,983 --> 03:14:55,359
What nakai

1401
03:15:17,119 --> 03:15:19,167
I really don't want to

1402
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:26,847
Hey Justin

1403
03:15:27,103 --> 03:15:33,247
Wait where is the arm binary is in the fish alarm binary

1404
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:39,647
It is there is in a pickle or binary

1405
03:16:14,975 --> 03:16:21,119
Do you need to get my hands I'm live USD

1406
03:16:22,143 --> 03:16:25,727
I can just copy the line

1407
03:16:27,775 --> 03:16:31,871
I don't need actually much that stuff

1408
03:16:35,455 --> 03:16:38,527
I don't need light x 11

1409
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:14,623
There's no way this is gonna link

1410
03:17:17,183 --> 03:17:18,463
There is no way

1411
03:17:27,167 --> 03:17:29,215
Not linked

1412
03:17:40,991 --> 03:17:45,087
Wow

1413
03:17:45,343 --> 03:17:51,487
0 lines of code needed to be changed

1414
03:17:56,351 --> 03:18:00,447
Well we'll see that right about that

1415
03:18:00,703 --> 03:18:05,311
Actually one thing I should do is I should do why forwarding

1416
03:18:06,079 --> 03:18:11,711
That way I can run things like eggs

1417
03:18:14,271 --> 03:18:17,855
Through the thing back to me

1418
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:24,255
Like this extern window is actually running on the Orange pi

1419
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:25,791
Lights off I've

1420
03:18:26,047 --> 03:18:31,167
Calibrate

1421
03:18:33,983 --> 03:18:36,287
You've gotta be kidding me

1422
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:42,687
Our can keep up though

1423
03:18:54,975 --> 03:19:01,119
What's right starting with Dave ortho cos that's gonna be the easiest one the wrong

1424
03:19:28,511 --> 03:19:32,607
Are jelly that's a really good point exporting might be slowing it down

1425
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:39,775
So we can run as you can do that black Adidas sockets webrecorder magic socket

1426
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:43,359
Name

1427
03:19:47,199 --> 03:19:49,759
And I will

1428
03:20:00,767 --> 03:20:04,863
Stop

1429
03:20:06,911 --> 03:20:08,447
How do you tell it

1430
03:20:34,815 --> 03:20:37,631
You can change the HTML page

1431
03:20:38,399 --> 03:20:39,935
Where how

1432
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:47,359
Window that location I can't override that

1433
03:20:47,615 --> 03:20:53,759
Friday's here

1434
03:21:06,303 --> 03:21:12,447
Now it's not keeping up

1435
03:21:24,223 --> 03:21:30,367
Website could be sucking down ok

1436
03:21:30,623 --> 03:21:36,767
J David Berger I think I know what I'm going to do this week

1437
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:42,911
I'm going to rewrite websocket D&C I can have all the features

1438
03:21:43,679 --> 03:21:49,823
By the way I journal I would have said goes just fine until that a minute ago in which case now and like

1439
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:51,615
Because

1440
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:53,663
There is no way

1441
03:21:55,711 --> 03:22:01,855
In esp8266 can do website as this world why why is

1442
03:22:02,111 --> 03:22:04,927
Websocket d not able to keep up

1443
03:22:06,463 --> 03:22:09,791
Ok

1444
03:22:19,007 --> 03:22:21,055
M&S

1445
03:22:21,311 --> 03:22:27,455
That's a good idea

1446
03:22:31,039 --> 03:22:35,135
I was so there is this other problem that happens with this sort of stuff where

1447
03:22:38,463 --> 03:22:39,231
Where

1448
03:22:39,487 --> 03:22:45,631
No you're right it could also just be using the poses that could be causing it

1449
03:22:45,887 --> 03:22:51,007
But it shouldn't be using 47%

1450
03:22:52,031 --> 03:22:58,175
Have you disable so there's this bug in people's brains for they think that

1451
03:22:58,431 --> 03:23:03,551
That's not SSL should be killed in there just there just wrong

1452
03:23:04,063 --> 03:23:08,671
And I don't see any way to do this without

1453
03:23:11,999 --> 03:23:16,607
It is website secure it isn't secured it's still not working

1454
03:23:20,703 --> 03:23:26,847
No ok my opinion is the website needs to go get

1455
03:23:27,871 --> 03:23:34,015
Yeah this is really lame but you're right I'm going to go to change it to use the

1456
03:23:34,271 --> 03:23:39,391
Sores / survive

1457
03:23:39,647 --> 03:23:45,791
Are processed us from one survived data

1458
03:23:46,047 --> 03:23:50,143
See in try using the trolls 2 simulator

1459
03:23:55,775 --> 03:23:59,359
Now ok fine we'll try moving it

1460
03:24:19,839 --> 03:24:25,983
I'm pretty sure it just doesn't have to go

1461
03:24:27,263 --> 03:24:29,823
I'm not using keyboard notes

1462
03:24:49,535 --> 03:24:52,351
Turn on smart keeping up

1463
03:24:56,191 --> 03:25:02,079
So what's happening is the second number is coming up and resetting because it missed a a packet

1464
03:25:09,247 --> 03:25:11,551
It doesn't need overclocking

1465
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:40,223
So there is another thing that we're going to have to eventually get around to doing and that's going to be

1466
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:41,247
2 on

1467
03:25:45,343 --> 03:25:51,487
That's going to be to dislike decouple the incoming data from

1468
03:25:51,743 --> 03:25:57,887
The system probably and I've been trying to like push that off but

1469
03:25:59,679 --> 03:26:00,447
Yeah

1470
03:26:02,495 --> 03:26:08,639
Oh no it's only using 14% CPU

1471
03:26:09,663 --> 03:26:14,271
Compilot I didn't recompile like good call

1472
03:26:28,351 --> 03:26:34,495
Quick guys throw some more things in chat that I would jump to conclusions quickly for

1473
03:26:40,383 --> 03:26:45,247
Time to turn off the infrared part of the camera

1474
03:27:21,087 --> 03:27:23,647
Can you not

1475
03:27:36,959 --> 03:27:37,983
Discrete

1476
03:27:56,671 --> 03:28:00,255
I got distracted

1477
03:28:00,767 --> 03:28:03,071
Yeah it's working

1478
03:28:03,327 --> 03:28:05,119
It was able to get past

1479
03:28:07,167 --> 03:28:09,727
That's good

1480
03:28:10,751 --> 03:28:12,031
That's really good

1481
03:28:23,039 --> 03:28:27,391
We'll have to go Duty more tweaks but right now

1482
03:28:42,495 --> 03:28:46,335
What's wrong mate I make sure that all the data coming in as expected

1483
03:28:59,391 --> 03:29:03,231
Ok so this is spectacular

1484
03:29:03,487 --> 03:29:05,279
Json

1485
03:29:12,191 --> 03:29:13,471
0

1486
03:29:13,983 --> 03:29:17,567
And hmd I think is what we want

1487
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:21,919
Please Ryan please run please run please run please run

1488
03:29:33,183 --> 03:29:35,231

03:29:40,351 --> 03:29:44,959
And because we're going to views

1491
03:29:45,215 --> 03:29:47,775
What's the name of the thing something shotgun

1492
03:29:48,287 --> 03:29:54,431
Euripides shotgun method of debugging where can I change two things

1493
03:29:54,687 --> 03:29:55,455
Stephanie John

1494
03:29:55,711 --> 03:29:59,807
Can I change two things at the same time

1495
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:07,231
Go back over here

1496
03:30:10,047 --> 03:30:12,863

I know you're going to tell me the news

1505
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:53,567
RSPCA

1506
03:31:21,215 --> 03:31:27,359
Does not seem to want a girl

1507
03:31:40,159 --> 03:31:43,231
I know the tractor visuals are not running on there

1508
03:31:45,535 --> 03:31:49,887
This is running on my computer

1509
03:31:51,679 --> 03:31:57,823
Hey Justin burger if you can look at the screen now or tell me what

1510
03:31:58,079 --> 03:32:00,383
I think I could do to find out why

1511
03:32:00,895 --> 03:32:04,223
This isn't working that would be awesome

1512
03:32:05,759 --> 03:32:08,575
I don't see The Catcher in the white House's

1513
03:32:09,855 --> 03:32:10,879
Maybe

1514
03:32:13,439 --> 03:32:16,255
It's fine let's try moving around

1515
03:32:34,943 --> 03:32:37,247
I'm thinking this is working

1516
03:32:42,111 --> 03:32:46,207
But

1517
03:32:46,463 --> 03:32:48,767
It's doing something

1518
03:32:49,791 --> 03:32:54,655
Ok

1519
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:59,519

03:33:14,367 --> 03:33:19,999
Figure out the configuration AdultWork so

1524
03:33:20,255 --> 03:33:26,399
Maybe if we can fit pose based off

1525
03:33:31,007 --> 03:33:32,287
Read a minute

1526
03:33:33,055 --> 03:33:34,335

Do I really want to do that that would be the us all I want to do isn't it

1530
03:33:53,535 --> 03:33:56,095

1534
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:14,783
The past like Josh Allen XL pressure in the chat he was the one that wrote the 0tx decoder

1535
03:34:15,039 --> 03:34:18,623
Candy configuration system ok

1538
03:34:32,447 --> 03:34:36,287
Do you like you do is just stop looking outside

1539
03:34:37,311 --> 03:34:39,359
Think it's going to work

1540
03:34:40,127 --> 03:34:41,407
Haha

1541
03:34:47,039 --> 03:34:51,391
So we have that they're gonna go back here pick up around

Codeword for talking in chat about something like

1549
03:35:58,719 --> 03:36:04,863

The goal

1554
03:36:21,247 --> 03:36:25,599
Is to hook up light survive to what we just did with Raja

1555
03:36:25,855 --> 03:36:27,647
To see if we can see

1556
03:36:27,903 --> 03:36:28,927
An object

1557
03:36:29,183 --> 03:36:35,327

I I think

1561
03:36:43,263 --> 03:36:45,055
I think it's going to happen

1562
03:36:46,079 --> 03:36:49,151
Ok guys I mean

1563
03:36:49,407 --> 03:36:51,199

1571
03:38:26,687 --> 03:38:29,503
Take me to back horse and fixes first

Heard

Might need to get tweaked

1593
03:44:28,415 --> 03:44:30,463
OK Google ok

1594
03:45:55,199 --> 03:46:00,319

1595
03:46:01,599 --> 03:46:03,135
Download should make batter

1596
03:46:03,647 --> 03:46:07,487
Difference ok so let's go back into this year

1597
03:46:07,999 --> 03:46:12,095
Now we're going to have to

1598
03:46:13,119 --> 03:46:15,935
Make a new tool

1599
03:46:21,311 --> 03:46:24,127
Live survive

1600
03:46:24,639 --> 03:46:27,711

Weather stuff

1626
03:54:09,535 --> 03:54:12,351
Or the stuff I don't know what that stuff is even

1627
03:54:14,399 --> 03:54:16,191
Why do you need to do this stuff

1628
03:54:17,215 --> 03:54:20,287
And I don't need to wait

1629
03:54:34,879 --> 03:54:37,695
Set the goal right now is just to get back to where we wore

1630
03:54:37,951 --> 03:54:39,487
With the yarn

1631
03:54:46,911 --> 03:54:49,471
Bacteria with destroying stuff in the

03:54:49,727 --> 03:54:51,007
Survive

1633
03:54:57,919 --> 03:54:59,967
What I do wrong

1634
03:55:00,223 --> 03:55:01,759
Nothing

1635
03:55:04,319 --> 03:55:05,087
Ok

1636
03:55:07,135 --> 03:55:08,927
So we need to get

1637
03:55:11,231 --> 03:55:12,511
Sinach

1638
03:55:13,791 --> 03:55:15,839
3D

1639
03:55:20,959 --> 03:55:21,983
Why is that night

1640
03:55:47,327 --> 03:55:48,351
Put away

1641
03:56:01,919 --> 03:56:03,711
Lionel living character for

1642
03:56:04,735 --> 03:56:10,879
Oh my gosh yes I was definitely I think I might be getting a migraine or something I started

1643
03:56:13,439 --> 03:56:17,023
Lapack

1644
03:56:20,095 --> 03:56:21,119
What is it called

1645
03:56:21,631 --> 03:56:23,935
Sea glass

1646
03:56:34,431 --> 03:56:40,575
Candyland

1647
03:56:40,831 --> 03:56:44,671
Ok C-Class apaki

1648
03:56:51,327 --> 03:56:55,423
Actually that's even wrong wow I am just losing my mind right now

1649
03:57:09,759 --> 03:57:15,903
See what's going on

1650
03:57:22,303 --> 03:57:25,375
I do see a full screen

1651
03:57:25,887 --> 03:57:32,031
Video of the things so

1652
03:58:03,775 --> 03:58:09,919
Actually do the pair

1653
03:58:10,175 --> 03:58:16,319
Sunglasses but I think it's a little bit ridiculous to coding these cos they are Led sunglasses which are

1654
03:58:16,575 --> 03:58:22,719
Very dark though I can still see everything with him so sure

1655
03:58:22,975 --> 03:58:29,119
Who do this

1656
03:58:29,375 --> 03:58:35,519
It hurt my eyes to maybe sunglasses

1657
03:58:35,775 --> 03:58:41,919
Stop alarm

1658
03:58:42,175 --> 03:58:48,319
I want to run with the same scene twice from two different points of View

1659
03:58:54,975 --> 03:59:01,119
I looked over the 5-in look up and it's just the sunglasses are so dark and I

1660
03:59:01,375 --> 03:59:07,519
Can't actually read text with sunglasses on or welding glasses

1661
03:59:07,775 --> 03:59:13,919
Where are there

1662
03:59:14,175 --> 03:59:20,319
It's too bright are that's an interesting point I should probably switch at 2 a.m.

1663
03:59:20,575 --> 03:59:26,719
Come on

1664
03:59:33,375 --> 03:59:39,519
Under the sea

1665
03:59:39,775 --> 03:59:45,919
Spice from two different points of View so I think I want to do is

1666
03:59:52,575 --> 03:59:58,719
Respective m here set up the

1667
03:59:58,975 --> 04:00:05,119
Newport

1668
04:00:30,975 --> 04:00:37,119
So

1669
04:00:37,375 --> 04:00:43,519
So everybody knows this is not the way you would ordinarily code a game this is tremendously horrendous

1670
04:00:43,775 --> 04:00:49,919
But I'm using RAW for a game it's just not care for it

1671
04:00:50,175 --> 04:00:56,319
What I have working right now so by Galley I'm gonna use it

1672
04:00:56,575 --> 04:01:02,719
So I should be able to do now as I struggle to say

1673
04:01:02,975 --> 04:01:09,119
Turn off rain and then what's 2160

1674
04:01:09,375 --> 04:01:15,519
1080

1675
04:01:15,775 --> 04:01:21,919
Add 1080 by 1080

1676
04:01:41,375 --> 04:01:47,519
At did not work at all

1677
04:01:53,663 --> 04:01:59,807
IC1

1678
04:02:00,063 --> 04:02:06,207
My left eye and nothing in my right eye

1679
04:02:07,487 --> 04:02:10,303
How do I see nothing in my right eye

1680
04:02:20,799 --> 04:02:25,919
What's

1681
04:02:58,687 --> 04:03:00,991
Probably fine

1682
04:03:01,247 --> 04:03:05,087
Ok the weather Toronto

1683
04:03:05,855 --> 04:03:09,439
Why nothing to displaying up in the other eye

1684
04:03:14,815 --> 04:03:20,959
Why am I getting only up yet

1685
04:03:21,215 --> 04:03:27,359
Google are mysteries going on right now

1686
04:03:27,615 --> 04:03:33,759
Is a water mysteries

1687
04:03:50,911 --> 04:03:57,055
Does anybody see why this which is not work

1688
04:03:57,311 --> 04:04:02,431
One-eyed

1689
04:04:45,951 --> 04:04:52,095
Offset axis should be 180 or 1080 cos I want to be over there

1690
04:05:13,087 --> 04:05:16,927
What's your local screenex in a local screenwipe

1691
04:05:17,183 --> 04:05:19,487
There's no confusion about that

1692
04:05:23,071 --> 04:05:28,191
How to use a are much wider field of view

1693
04:05:34,847 --> 04:05:40,991
See something in my left eye nothing in my right

1694
04:05:47,647 --> 04:05:53,791
No there isn't

1695
04:06:32,447 --> 04:06:38,591
What what train will see what happens

1696
04:06:38,847 --> 04:06:44,991
I think that's going to make the second frame a very wide frame but what's a

1697
04:06:51,647 --> 04:06:57,791
What is definitely interesting you put it in the middle instead of off to one side

1698
04:06:58,047 --> 04:07:04,191
So maybe it's

1699
04:07:04,447 --> 04:07:06,751
It's just nice pushing it over

1700
04:07:08,543 --> 04:07:11,615
Oh it's not using hpto jump that's why

1701
04:07:36,703 --> 04:07:41,311
ADHD so ABC

1702
04:07:54,367 --> 04:08:00,511
Well it's something awful

1703
04:08:04,607 --> 04:08:09,727
How would I stream this to you guys

1704
04:08:10,239 --> 04:08:13,567
I'll show you guys whenever I get it working

1705
04:08:26,623 --> 04:08:32,767
Almost

1706
04:08:33,023 --> 04:08:39,167
It looks like the centre of the frame is not actually

1707
04:08:39,423 --> 04:08:45,567
Like centre of each frame

1708
04:08:45,823 --> 04:08:51,967
Does anybody remember a diopter

1709
04:08:52,223 --> 04:08:58,367
What's the same seller to tan so that would be

1710
04:08:58,623 --> 04:09:04,767
Minus diopter in this process died after make it 40

1711
04:09:05,023 --> 04:09:11,167
That

1712
04:09:11,423 --> 04:09:17,567
Crazy like wrong but

1713
04:09:17,823 --> 04:09:23,967
So I'm this

1714
04:09:24,223 --> 04:09:30,367
You have one and I'm just by you have the of

1715
04:09:30,623 --> 04:09:36,767
That's that's pretty good now

1716
04:09:37,023 --> 04:09:43,167
Snow like separation between the two but that's ok for the moment

1717
04:09:43,423 --> 04:09:49,567
Try to do next is make it so that the I can be adjusted for Peugeot point

1718
04:10:00,831 --> 04:10:04,159
So you actually don't want to spin around like that it all

1719
04:10:06,463 --> 04:10:12,607
See how we just want to pass i n

1720
04:10:15,679 --> 04:10:20,799
What is the size of this thing that were looking at this

1721
04:10:21,055 --> 04:10:27,199
What UNIS deeprot nhmh my

1722
04:10:34,111 --> 04:10:35,903
I bet it's huge

1723
04:10:36,159 --> 04:10:37,951
Probably huge

1724
04:10:38,207 --> 04:10:39,487
I have to steal a dance song

1725
04:10:40,767 --> 04:10:43,071
Like my kind of you

1726
04:10:43,327 --> 04:10:49,471
If you was weird that I'm finally getting the point in something where we're going to be talking about

1727
04:10:49,727 --> 04:10:54,335
Things an actual unit so when I say 40 units it'll be 40 m by

1728
04:10:54,847 --> 04:10:57,151
Dead so

1729
04:10:57,663 --> 04:11:03,807
Ok

1730
04:11:04,063 --> 04:11:08,671
I'm gonna just put up I won

1731
04:11:08,927 --> 04:11:15,071
0111

1732
04:11:15,327 --> 04:11:19,935
And I still at 111 as well

1733
04:11:20,191 --> 04:11:22,495
You should be looking at the thing

1734
04:11:22,751 --> 04:11:28,127
I think the one thing we're going to have to do is change

1735
04:11:28,383 --> 04:11:31,199
Scaling on the height map

1736
04:11:33,247 --> 04:11:39,391
Undo that got to see what we say

1737
04:11:39,647 --> 04:11:45,791
Free Guy

1738
04:11:46,047 --> 04:11:52,191
Look at home it's a very top I see something so not really sure why that's all the way up there

1739
04:11:52,447 --> 04:11:58,591
It is up there in both eyes the same those that's good

1740
04:11:58,847 --> 04:12:04,991
Ok I'll see here what will be next

1741
04:12:17,791 --> 04:12:19,071
Stop

1742
04:12:19,327 --> 04:12:22,911
First I need to do one thing affects the performance

1743
04:12:23,935 --> 04:12:26,495
3

1744
04:12:30,335 --> 04:12:33,151
Yeah that was definitely a migraine coming on

1745
04:12:34,687 --> 04:12:38,271
Staff we must persevere

1746
04:12:44,159 --> 04:12:45,439
Hall and about 1

1747
04:13:00,543 --> 04:13:03,359
Ok so it is Center but it's very large

1748
04:13:04,383 --> 04:13:10,527
Height map

1749
04:13:10,783 --> 04:13:16,927
Sub

1750
04:13:36,383 --> 04:13:42,527
You should probably try scaling

1751
04:13:42,783 --> 04:13:48,927
Scale here

1752
04:14:10,431 --> 04:14:16,575
Hi

1753
04:14:16,831 --> 04:14:22,975
Play up

1754
04:14:23,231 --> 04:14:29,375
Why is that

1755
04:14:33,471 --> 04:14:39,615
Car right now

1756
04:14:59,071 --> 04:15:01,631
24 look at

1757
04:15:03,423 --> 04:15:09,567
Not exactly the same

1758
04:15:09,823 --> 04:15:11,615
You're doing something stupid

1759
04:15:12,383 --> 04:15:14,943
What can we be doing that stupid

1760
04:15:23,903 --> 04:15:27,231
You know whatever this movie I asked song

1761
04:15:48,991 --> 04:15:55,135
What makes no sense

1762
04:15:55,391 --> 04:16:01,535
Diverse

1763
04:16:43,775 --> 04:16:49,919
Crucify applied to scale there that does anything

1764
04:16:51,455 --> 04:16:55,807
Here

1765
04:17:05,791 --> 04:17:11,935
But you know what I can do I can just manually change point it's fine

1766
04:17:49,055 --> 04:17:55,199
Performer concerning the night

1767
04:17:55,455 --> 04:18:01,599
Use the lookup function O2 are so right now

1768
04:18:01,855 --> 04:18:07,999
In the centre of frame the

1769
04:18:08,255 --> 04:18:14,399
That's working I don't know

1770
04:18:14,655 --> 04:18:16,703
Why I can't get the same effect

1771
04:18:17,215 --> 04:18:19,007
I just moving the eye back

1772
04:18:47,935 --> 04:18:54,079
Exactly the same effect

1773
04:18:54,335 --> 04:19:00,479
That's good

1774
04:19:00,735 --> 04:19:06,879
Ok so the nice thing about that would be that means two things one if we were 50 m away that's what

1775
04:19:07,135 --> 04:19:13,279
Look like brown inside my house so we can get 50 m away at the most we could really get it up to me away

1776
04:19:13,535 --> 04:19:19,679
What the thing looks like it out

1777
04:19:27,103 --> 04:19:33,247
The kind of big at 1 m away

1778
04:19:33,503 --> 04:19:39,647
What's drinking a little bit

1779
04:19:49,887 --> 04:19:56,031
0.05 ok so now the next thing to do is hooky and live survive

1780
04:20:02,175 --> 04:20:08,319
Actually probably want to start its own trailer

1781
04:20:10,623 --> 04:20:13,951
So what we can do that is we can go look at

1782
04:20:19,071 --> 04:20:20,607
I won't forget to call my mum back

1783
04:20:22,399 --> 04:20:25,215
Our source

1784

Obama discussion group Whitchurch was cancelled for tomorrow

1788
04:21:12,063 --> 04:21:18,207
Anyway let's go look and see how

1789
04:21:18,463 --> 04:21:22,047
Data recorder works

1790
04:21:25,375 --> 04:21:27,423
Not need any of this junk

1791
04:21:27,679 --> 04:21:29,215
Where does junk

1792
04:21:31,519 --> 04:21:37,663
Hey Justin are you still in there if so what is the command for actually getting the final close

1793
04:21:37,919 --> 04:21:38,431
Back it up

1794
04:22:03,263 --> 04:22:07,615
No like what's the survival after install to get the nice

1795
04:22:07,871 --> 04:22:13,759
Like the pose that you randomly your thing with the hook into it

1796
04:22:28,095 --> 04:22:34,239
My Rob process pose pose I don't think

1797
04:22:34,495 --> 04:22:40,639
What a nice pretty bows and question is there any way to prevent it from trying to do lighthouse calibration right

1798
04:22:43,455 --> 04:22:47,295
No I don't want lighthouse calibration

1799
04:23:19,039 --> 04:23:24,927
Go to ducal install so right now if I run this it should not do Cal install

1800
04:23:25,439 --> 04:23:31,583
Ptx

1801
04:23:54,367 --> 04:23:57,183
Outright

1802
04:23:57,439 --> 04:24:00,255
Always have a hard time remembering capitalization start

1803
04:24:32,511 --> 04:24:35,583
Going to try the rotten world

1804
04:24:40,703 --> 04:24:44,287
I want to just say

1805
04:24:49,919 --> 04:24:52,479
What is incompatible about it

1806
04:25:01,183 --> 04:25:06,303
I'm going to hold the over here come on

1807
04:25:07,583 --> 04:25:09,119
Oh ok

1808
04:25:10,911 --> 04:25:17,055
Sea flags

1809
04:25:17,311 --> 04:25:19,103
Equals double

1810
04:25:31,903 --> 04:25:34,975
Wait why is there redefining

1811
04:26:08,511 --> 04:26:14,655
So I might have to rebuild long time ago no it's gone

1812
04:26:14,911 --> 04:26:21,055
Ok just so what am I missing

1813
04:26:21,311 --> 04:26:27,455
Offered to the chat diary of something

1814
04:26:53,055 --> 04:26:59,199
I want I can use that

1815
04:27:07,135 --> 04:27:13,279
Ok so now we have a pose

1816
04:27:39,135 --> 04:27:45,279
That's working

1817
04:27:48,095 --> 04:27:49,375
Next thing

1818
04:27:49,887 --> 04:27:54,751
We're going after render the eyes from two slightly different point of view let's try that right here

1819
04:27:55,519 --> 04:27:57,311
21

1820
04:28:18,047 --> 04:28:23,679
That's obscenely wrong

1821
04:28:40,575 --> 04:28:46,719
Is the opposite of what to do

1822
04:28:54,143 --> 04:29:00,287
Hey does anybody know how I would be able to share terminal

1823
04:29:00,543 --> 04:29:06,687
Make it so that other people online can see the terminal and by train

1824
04:29:06,943 --> 04:29:13,087
I mean the Castle

1825
04:29:13,343 --> 04:29:19,487
No no the tramadol the hardware camel dive fb0

1826
04:29:23,583 --> 04:29:25,631
From the

1827
04:29:25,887 --> 04:29:29,727
I can get a bottle of brown know what to do with the buffer

1828
04:29:31,519 --> 04:29:36,383
I think there is a thing on PS4

1829
04:29:38,431 --> 04:29:44,575
It would be on a separate computer

1830
04:29:51,999 --> 04:29:58,143
Ok so probably

1831
04:30:04,799 --> 04:30:10,943
Ok this might work yeah I think 0.7 with work

1832
04:30:11,199 --> 04:30:17,343
I think it's just a little bit too big so that's good so what were going to want to do right now

1833
04:30:17,599 --> 04:30:21,183
What's the advised to be the same

1834
04:30:21,439 --> 04:30:23,231
Hand

1835
04:30:25,279 --> 04:30:27,839
It's going to be all wrong

1836
04:30:31,167 --> 04:30:37,311
To take into account the where the agency is looking

1837
04:30:47,807 --> 04:30:51,391
So what I really need to do is convert the quote into a matrix

1838
04:31:06,495 --> 04:31:09,055
What do matrix

1839
04:31:20,319 --> 04:31:22,367
That's not exactly what I want to do is it

1840
04:31:33,119 --> 04:31:39,263
Morpheus if you are you go do it that would be that would be kinda need to be up for trying it

1841
04:31:54,367 --> 04:31:59,487
No I think I will use item up it does feel right

1842
04:32:01,279 --> 04:32:05,887
I will Star at fullstar up

1843
04:32:06,143 --> 04:32:11,263
Done I'm going to

1844
04:32:30,207 --> 04:32:34,047
What's TMAX

1845
04:32:37,375 --> 04:32:43,007
UB40

1846
04:32:49,151 --> 04:32:51,967
I'm just a security login right now

1847
04:33:00,159 --> 04:33:03,999
But I can screen only works attacked

1848
04:33:08,095 --> 04:33:14,239
No I'm trying to get this video I'm out puddings 2 / 10 / fp0

1849
04:33:15,519 --> 04:33:21,663
Yes

1850
04:33:21,919 --> 04:33:24,735
Ok cancel

1851
04:33:24,991 --> 04:33:29,343
Fb.con which is the frame buffer console

1852
04:33:42,911 --> 04:33:48,799
Yeah I want to hear the fp02 something so I can show you guys

1853
04:33:50,335 --> 04:33:51,359
It's fine

1854
04:33:51,871 --> 04:33:57,759
Maybe you feeling vidstreaming might be quite slow on the OPI

1855
04:33:58,015 --> 04:34:03,135
Only getting 1 FPS that's probably sufficient for the sake of this

1856
04:34:03,391 --> 04:34:06,975
I think it'd be really needed you guys for watching this thing finally happened

1857
04:34:07,487 --> 04:34:13,631
I have

1858
04:34:13,887 --> 04:34:15,679
Not ideal

1859
04:34:20,287 --> 04:34:26,431
Yeah you should just be able to open Dev fb0 and then like is

1860
04:34:26,687 --> 04:34:28,991
Nm-applet into memory

1861
04:34:42,047 --> 04:34:48,191
Start time for a bit even if you guys are nice in 1-ft

1862
04:34:48,447 --> 04:34:54,591
I'm sure that's fine

1863
04:35:20,447 --> 04:35:26,591
Goodnight

1864
04:35:39,647 --> 04:35:45,791
Apply poster 0.1

1865
04:36:05,247 --> 04:36:11,391
Ok so I guess what I will do is I'll pretend that might

1866
04:36:11,647 --> 04:36:17,791
Days are where they are in my head so one I would be at

1867
04:36:18,047 --> 04:36:24,191
According to this thing it would be at -7 cm

1868
04:36:24,447 --> 04:36:30,591
They said no it doesn't make any sense of it

1869
04:36:30,847 --> 04:36:36,991
No that's should be like that 14 mm 1.4 mm so

1870
04:36:37,247 --> 04:36:43,391
0.0014

1871
04:36:43,647 --> 04:36:49,791
Can I one can I two

1872
04:36:50,047 --> 04:36:56,191
Is it really 7335

1873
04:36:56,447 --> 04:37:02,591
I don't believe I'll do 30

1874
04:37:02,847 --> 04:37:08,991
Exaggerated but ok

1875
04:37:09,247 --> 04:37:15,391
Set for last I want to make sure we get our orientation right

1876
04:37:15,647 --> 04:37:21,791

1877
04:37:22,047 --> 04:37:28,191
Arise - x

1878
04:37:28,447 --> 04:37:34,591
Why do you think it's fine we'll

1879
04:37:34,847 --> 04:37:40,991
You guys don't need a lot of a lot of FPS

1880
04:38:00,447 --> 04:38:06,591
I guess we're looking at

1881
04:38:19,647 --> 04:38:25,791
Looking Glass

1882
04:38:26,047 --> 04:38:32,191
Hey that looks exactly like what I want

1883
04:38:32,447 --> 04:38:35,263
What is the tool and never heard of it can you get leg

1884
04:38:42,431 --> 04:38:43,711
Can

1885
04:38:44,735 --> 04:38:46,783
At

1886
04:38:49,343 --> 04:38:55,487
CCS very far past

1887
04:38:55,743 --> 04:38:57,791

1889
04:39:09,567 --> 04:39:12,639
Turn off

1890
04:39:20,575 --> 04:39:21,855
That would be

1891
04:39:22,111 --> 04:39:24,415
0

1892
04:39:25,951 --> 04:39:31,071
SY1

1893
04:39:43,615 --> 04:39:44,639
Ok

1894
04:39:45,407 --> 04:39:48,735
There's a very low chance for this is going to work

1895
04:39:53,343 --> 04:39:59,487
Ok Nicky discord now click on it

1896
04:39:59,743 --> 04:40:05,887
Just straight up transfer like devafuser work

1897
04:40:06,143 --> 04:40:09,215
Compiler is out so I'm not going to

1898
04:40:10,239 --> 04:40:14,847
To do this right yet until

1899
04:40:16,127 --> 04:40:21,247
Until you guys are watching

1900
04:40:35,583 --> 04:40:38,399
How's pin-up mod

04:42:42,815 --> 04:42:48,959
Oh this is going to require a way more than what I'm doing here we're just trying to get

1907
04:42:49,215 --> 04:42:50,239
Basic stuff together

1908
04:43:26,335 --> 04:43:32,479
I am not interested in the right answer I am interested in the worst possible answer that gets us what we need

1909
04:43:48,095 --> 04:43:54,239
My bill but I'm not going to work through this until we have some way I'm showing you guys

05:14:17,215 --> 05:14:20,543
Can't smell

2146
05:14:27,711 --> 05:14:31,807
JPEG size stupid so stupid site header header

2147
05:14:32,063 --> 05:14:34,111
TVR

2148
05:14:36,671 --> 05:14:40,767
From highly

2149
05:14:53,823 --> 05:14:56,639
The address for B

2150
05:14:56,895 --> 05:15:00,479
18080 / snap.svg

2151
05:15:14,047 --> 05:15:14,815
Hello

2152
05:15:37,087 --> 05:15:39,647
Contact 90

2153
05:16:00,895 --> 05:16:04,223
So you know what I didn't update the fire

2154
05:16:06,271 --> 05:16:11,903
Update the size

2155
05:16:16,511 --> 05:16:18,559
I know Harris don't start with dash dash

2156
05:16:18,815 --> 05:16:21,375
Does it mean won't work

2157
05:16:27,519 --> 05:16:28,287
Medium

2158
05:16:31,103 --> 05:16:35,711
Ok fine maybe won't work it out

2159
05:16:38,527 --> 05:16:40,063
How to make it work

2160
05:17:19,231 --> 05:17:21,535
I actually do get the header

2161
05:17:22,047 --> 05:17:24,607
I can't there some sort of really terrible

2162
05:17:25,631 --> 05:17:27,935
Magic going on

2163
05:17:52,255 --> 05:17:53,791
GU10 2800k

2164
05:17:54,047 --> 05:17:57,119
That's weird

2165
05:17:58,143 --> 05:18:00,191
Set lights to do that

2166
05:18:01,983 --> 05:18:07,103
Content area content type

2167
05:18:09,919 --> 05:18:12,991
Multipart x mixed replace

2168
05:18:25,791 --> 05:18:31,935
Boundary equals

2169
05:18:32,191 --> 05:18:38,335
464

2170
05:18:53,183 --> 05:18:54,719
Hey check that out

2171
05:18:59,071 --> 05:19:05,215
Electronic

2172
05:19:05,471 --> 05:19:09,567
You guys can see what happens

2173
05:19:10,847 --> 05:19:16,223
Alcohol yes probably

2174
05:19:16,479 --> 05:19:21,855
Lol Locker mythos

2175
05:19:24,671 --> 05:19:30,815
Ocular actually

2176
05:19:31,071 --> 05:19:33,119
My credentials again

2177
05:19:52,319 --> 05:19:58,463
KFC is that what I'm actually seeing through the headset

2178
05:19:58,719 --> 05:20:04,863
Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying to the headset

2179
05:20:11,519 --> 05:20:17,663
And in fact it's not updating

2180
05:20:17,919 --> 05:20:19,967
Close information and see what's going on

2181
05:20:26,367 --> 05:20:32,255
All the colours are all backwards but who cares about colours so you know what is even a better way to do this

2182
05:20:32,511 --> 05:20:36,095
Oh this we can just reorder the colours by like

2183
05:20:36,607 --> 05:20:41,215
Off-by-one in it

2184
05:20:41,727 --> 05:20:45,567
I want to see what happens because it's going to be fun

2185
05:20:47,103 --> 05:20:48,127
Reduce a random

2186
05:20:48,383 --> 05:20:52,735
Set reviews

2187
05:20:53,759 --> 05:20:57,855
I don't think so

2188
05:21:23,711 --> 05:21:26,527
The colours the same

2189
05:21:47,519 --> 05:21:53,663
You know guys I if this doesn't fix the colours after the going through the trial

2190
05:21:57,503 --> 05:22:00,063
That's actually completely wrong there

2191
05:22:01,343 --> 05:22:04,927
Very cool looking

2192
05:22:12,607 --> 05:22:15,423
Ask you can see the

2193
05:22:15,935 --> 05:22:18,239
The cursor blinking up here

2194
05:22:19,007 --> 05:22:20,799
You could see the cursor blinking

2195
05:22:24,127 --> 05:22:30,271
Put the order in here maybe somewhere just

2196
05:22:37,951 --> 05:22:40,255
No I think I want rgba

2197
05:22:51,263 --> 05:22:54,079
Time

2198
05:22:56,639 --> 05:22:59,199
One thing I really want to find out

2199
05:22:59,711 --> 05:23:04,063
Arm what happens if I do that

2200
05:23:04,831 --> 05:23:08,159
This is a load of attention

2201
05:23:11,231 --> 05:23:12,511
I'm really curious

2202
05:23:24,799 --> 05:23:26,591
Can the browser handle this

2203
05:23:30,431 --> 05:23:35,551
There is nothing in the content type that would indicators jpeg

2204
05:23:54,751 --> 05:23:58,079
15 by 2

2205
05:24:02,943 --> 05:24:07,807
Keep my we are on in arm so it is all sorts of probable that it's wacky

2206
05:24:14,463 --> 05:24:17,791
That's almost really actually

2207
05:24:20,863 --> 05:24:23,935
No it's so wrong

2208
05:24:24,191 --> 05:24:28,287
What colour is that it's red yellow Israel Iran

2209
05:24:37,503 --> 05:24:40,319
Looks like just implying it's good enough

2210
05:24:41,599 --> 05:24:44,415
Strongly suggesting that it might be mjpeg

2211
05:24:47,743 --> 05:24:50,559
Stream anything that's awful

2212
05:24:51,839 --> 05:24:55,679
Ok looks like you guys are going to be getting your foot colour order

2213
05:24:56,191 --> 05:24:57,215
Sorry dude

2214
05:25:20,256 --> 05:25:23,840
Ok so this is happening right now which is wrong

2215
05:25:24,096 --> 05:25:28,192
Because were supposed to be somewhere and looking at something

2216
05:25:28,448 --> 05:25:34,336
Definitely not worth seeing something to go print out the clothes here and see what lights revives telling us

2217
05:25:39,456 --> 05:25:41,760
Wait does it actually say Imogen somewhere

2218
05:25:42,784 --> 05:25:44,320
Oh I'm an idiot

2219
05:25:47,392 --> 05:25:49,696
Final ghost in 5-minutes to check the test

2220
05:25:50,720 --> 05:25:56,608
And tried tested p&g

2221
05:26:16,064 --> 05:26:22,208
Yeah I don't think browser is no handle motion Cian juice like that

2222
05:26:22,464 --> 05:26:28,608
So for some reason my stomach getting close information

2223
05:26:28,864 --> 05:26:35,008
Revert

2224
05:26:41,664 --> 05:26:47,808
JPEGs to files to JPEGs JPEGs

2225
05:26:48,064 --> 05:26:54,208
All the way down

2226
05:26:54,464 --> 05:27:00,608
Yes fpzero is an app straight onto Matt Dillon

2227
05:27:00,864 --> 05:27:07,008
Emma can that be what

2228
05:27:07,264 --> 05:27:13,408
Pause it as you can open up a file but pretend that is just a bunch of memory that we don't have to read things in or out of it

2229
05:27:13,664 --> 05:27:19,808
Can just go read data like an array is so it's part of the file itself 250g

2230
05:27:20,064 --> 05:27:26,208
Instead of having to like speak to you want and read out what you want then seek somewhere else you can do

2231
05:27:26,464 --> 05:27:32,608
Napit directly into memory and then you can just access stuff in the erase you would just feel like it

2232
05:27:32,864 --> 05:27:39,008
Emma Disney

2233
05:27:39,264 --> 05:27:45,408
That's that's really wrong

2234
05:27:52,064 --> 05:27:58,208
Why are we getting

2235
05:27:58,464 --> 05:28:04,608
Lights alive

2236
05:28:04,864 --> 05:28:11,008
That's right

2237
05:28:11,264 --> 05:28:17,408
Boss orange pytest' history grab

2238
05:28:17,664 --> 05:28:23,808
Orange hi test

2239
05:28:24,064 --> 05:28:30,208
We have to pass it to write parameter if you want to get the data

2240
05:28:30,464 --> 05:28:36,608
And we also do that

2241
05:28:49,664 --> 05:28:55,808
That is

2242
05:28:56,064 --> 05:29:02,208
Lee Ryan

2243
05:29:02,464 --> 05:29:08,608
By the way it's

2244
05:29:08,864 --> 05:29:15,008
Pretty going to be in the glasses to them now

2245
05:29:28,064 --> 05:29:34,208
It is actually

2246
05:29:40,864 --> 05:29:47,008
General effects on them

2247
05:29:47,264 --> 05:29:53,408
Working

2248
05:30:00,064 --> 05:30:06,208
Turn down

2249
05:30:06,464 --> 05:30:12,608
Oh my gosh

2250
05:30:12,864 --> 05:30:19,008
It is like I can walk around the thing it's just

2251
05:30:19,264 --> 05:30:25,408
Downer anything

2252
05:30:32,064 --> 05:30:38,208
So right now I'm saying it from one side song

2253
05:30:51,264 --> 05:30:57,408
Intensifiers

2254
05:30:57,664 --> 05:31:03,808
From underneath

2255
05:31:04,064 --> 05:31:10,208
The way to use oh my gosh no

2256
05:31:16,864 --> 05:31:23,008
Someone you loved

2257
05:31:36,064 --> 05:31:42,208
Route

2258
05:31:48,864 --> 05:31:55,008
It should not be doing now

2259
05:32:01,664 --> 05:32:07,808
If I rotate my head one way

2260
05:32:08,064 --> 05:32:14,208
The other way is actually rotating the object appropriately so that's really good

2261
05:32:14,464 --> 05:32:20,608
This is as Jackie is it should be oh my god

2262
05:32:20,864 --> 05:32:27,008
Survive on an Orange Pi while streaming of with the world's worst witch

2263
05:32:40,064 --> 05:32:46,208
Who are the care of you watching record apple

2264
05:32:46,464 --> 05:32:52,608
I can walk over here and see if I can still on hit the chair

2265
05:32:52,864 --> 05:32:59,008
Set the heart I'm cracking

2266
05:33:05,664 --> 05:33:11,808
All the way around the chair without hitting it

2267
05:33:12,064 --> 05:33:18,208
Only use the headset to tell me where I think the chair is

2268
05:33:18,464 --> 05:33:24,608
The chair

2269
05:33:24,864 --> 05:33:31,008
So this is actually working I am running

2270
05:33:31,264 --> 05:33:37,408
I am running at successfully on the Orange pi

2271
05:33:37,664 --> 05:33:43,808
The world's worst VR system

2272
05:33:56,864 --> 05:34:03,008
Ok I'm going to go put the

2273
05:34:16,064 --> 05:34:22,208
This might be the very first live stream where

2274
05:34:22,464 --> 05:34:28,608
Where we try to do something and it may have worked

2275
05:34:28,864 --> 05:34:34,496
What is the happiest 100fps

2276
05:34:34,752 --> 05:34:40,896
Yeah I'm sorry 90fps so that's working out it's just lights off

2277
05:34:41,152 --> 05:34:47,296
When is absolutely janky

2278
05:34:53,952 --> 05:35:00,096
What's a top

2279
05:35:13,152 --> 05:35:19,296
The thing was visible to everyone right like I didn't actually put it behind something I shouldn't have right

2280
05:35:25,952 --> 05:35:32,096
What is orange Pi podcast ok that's fair in fbstreams using a

2281
05:35:32,352 --> 05:35:38,496
Even though it's system

2282
05:35:38,752 --> 05:35:44,896
What's the thing even doing

2283
05:35:51,552 --> 05:35:57,696
Pause

2284
05:35:57,952 --> 05:36:04,096
This is a livestream I'm going to be releasing

2285
05:36:10,752 --> 05:36:16,896
Change the way this works I'm gonna go change fbstream

2286
05:36:17,152 --> 05:36:23,296
So it copies it to a butter first and then send ZL

2287
05:37:08,352 --> 05:37:14,496
What else I can do is

2288
05:37:21,152 --> 05:37:27,296
Happy Direct action should be with 32

2289
05:38:37,952 --> 05:38:44,096
I think I just written the worst code I've written in

2290
05:38:44,352 --> 05:38:50,496
Years and I had a blast

2291
05:38:57,152 --> 05:39:03,296
Hey this is a lot better now or not

2292
05:39:03,552 --> 05:39:09,696
You're going to do work

2293
05:39:09,952 --> 05:39:16,096
Send 8:30 pixels

2294
05:40:13,952 --> 05:40:20,096
No I call Mike ice papa is dropping the green channel

2295
05:40:20,352 --> 05:40:26,496
Aladdin the green channel

2296
05:40:58,752 --> 05:41:04,896
That way

2297
05:41:17,952 --> 05:41:24,096
We can do it that way now

2298
05:41:24,352 --> 05:41:30,496
You know it's starting to get fun this is this is little

2299
05:41:30,752 --> 05:41:36,896
The worst code I ever actually remember writing even though if

2300
05:41:37,152 --> 05:41:43,296
I don't even

2301
05:41:56,352 --> 05:42:02,496
I don't even know how it's doing whatever it's doing that's

2302
05:42:02,752 --> 05:42:08,896
I truly horrendous

2303
05:42:09,152 --> 05:42:15,296
This is

2304
05:42:15,552 --> 05:42:21,696
What is this chat how do I write what is this I want to do this bank somebody just send me another one

2305
05:42:21,952 --> 05:42:28,096
72a terminals route

2306
05:42:28,352 --> 05:42:34,496
I don't know what I looking for here what is

2307
05:42:34,752 --> 05:42:40,896
Oh snap

2308
05:42:41,152 --> 05:42:47,296
I am going to have to turn off the dri2 bug

2309
05:42:47,552 --> 05:42:53,696
Stuff that can cause all sorts of problems

2310
05:42:53,952 --> 05:43:00,096
Yeah let's do that

2311
05:43:23,392 --> 05:43:29,536
Dr on the bog with her 2ff that's probably not needed

2312
05:43:36,960 --> 05:43:43,104
Right now though I just want to get this thing working again with

2313
05:43:49,760 --> 05:43:55,904
What's right to me

2314
05:44:08,960 --> 05:44:15,104
Definitely

2315
05:44:15,360 --> 05:44:21,504
How to stop that systemd alarm from stewing everywhere eventually as soon as

2316
05:44:21,760 --> 05:44:27,904
Should get fixed

2317
05:44:28,160 --> 05:44:34,304
That's really

2318
05:44:34,560 --> 05:44:40,704
Really low quality

2319
05:45:06,560 --> 05:45:12,704
Yodel

2320
05:45:19,360 --> 05:45:25,504
Is it out of 100 I think it's one two or three

2321
05:45:32,160 --> 05:45:38,304
No the problem is it with you when you some colour is that

2322
05:45:38,560 --> 05:45:44,704
It's it's actually really bad

2323
05:45:44,960 --> 05:45:51,104
Appreciate it

2324
05:45:51,360 --> 05:45:57,504
Actually it's need

2325
05:45:57,760 --> 05:46:03,904
So what you actually seen here is your seen the colour channels bleed into each other across

2326
05:46:04,160 --> 05:46:10,304
The B boundaries that's why it's doing that wacky stuff they're because when we divide by

2327
05:46:10,560 --> 05:46:16,704
Or it's bringing the least significant bit into the next lowest register which

2328
05:46:16,960 --> 05:46:23,104
Play really do a really awful tricky fix bad in week by doing it this way we could say

2329
05:46:23,360 --> 05:46:29,504
And 0 x arm

2330
05:46:29,760 --> 05:46:35,904
ABC CCFC FC

2331
05:46:36,160 --> 05:46:42,304
It's going to do is stop the the best better than all registers when we shift down from going into the

2332
05:46:42,560 --> 05:46:48,704
Next upper thing is no longer that Dad is

2333
05:46:48,960 --> 05:46:55,104
And operator in there

2334
05:46:55,360 --> 05:47:01,504
Why did that happen like that a dark

2335
05:47:01,760 --> 05:47:07,904
CSCS

2336
05:47:08,160 --> 05:47:14,304
CSCS c

2337
05:47:33,760 --> 05:47:39,904
I'm having the wrong B I think

2338
05:47:40,160 --> 05:47:46,304
I am hitting the wrong B C

2339
05:47:46,560 --> 05:47:52,704
CSCS

2340
05:47:52,960 --> 05:47:59,104
No wouldn't be bitswap I think that I'm I was accounting for favourite

2341
05:47:59,360 --> 05:48:05,504
Already down but they may not be see what happens if I know I did

2342
05:48:12,160 --> 05:48:18,304
It might be

2343
05:48:24,960 --> 05:48:31,104
Yeah I think I'm eating the other bits so I think I want to hear I think this is right

2344
05:48:31,360 --> 05:48:37,504
Now it's still wrong

2345
05:48:37,760 --> 05:48:43,904
Ch3f ok news only

2346
05:48:44,160 --> 05:48:50,304
Anyways this could be you want exhaust them

2347
05:48:56,960 --> 05:49:03,104
He's right you can't do this while separating each colour last

2348
05:49:03,360 --> 05:49:09,504
Well

2349
05:49:09,760 --> 05:49:15,904
Turn off

2350
05:49:16,160 --> 05:49:22,304
You can do it up here

2351
05:49:41,760 --> 05:49:47,904
Yeah I don't know if this is right or wrong

2352
05:49:48,160 --> 05:49:54,304
Not apparently 200% correct but exactly how you do it

2353
05:49:54,560 --> 05:50:00,704
Ok so that's actually pretty good quality now

2354
05:50:00,960 --> 05:50:07,104
Why would I

2355
05:50:07,360 --> 05:50:13,504
Down as it's too far away and I look up it's so much better

2356
05:50:13,760 --> 05:50:19,904
You know what

2357
05:50:20,160 --> 05:50:26,304
I make need to

2358
05:50:32,960 --> 05:50:39,104
Yeah I am just needing the the resolution

2359
05:50:39,360 --> 05:50:45,504
Actually no we could have just scrap all of this and you guys can just look at every like for pixel

2360
05:50:45,760 --> 05:50:51,904
You don't need to see them all

2361
05:50:58,560 --> 05:51:04,704
Why didn't I just do that first it's obviously the awful way to do it

2362
05:51:11,360 --> 05:51:17,504
Sapphire walking down

2363
05:51:30,560 --> 05:51:36,704
Firework Down it looks

2364
05:51:36,960 --> 05:51:43,104
Really far away and look up it gets much bigger and that's definitely

2365
05:51:43,360 --> 05:51:49,504
So let's see what could be causing that

2366
05:51:49,760 --> 05:51:55,904
I would definitely stay the system awful cold it's very good results

2367
05:51:56,160 --> 05:52:02,304
Stop pretty much admin that was an hour of my considering now it's a streaming

2368
05:52:02,560 --> 05:52:08,704
JP web server that reads from memory mapped file and streams

2369
05:52:08,960 --> 05:52:15,104
It's pretty good for an hour

2370
05:52:15,360 --> 05:52:21,504
So one thing that sometimes happens is a look at some times

2371
05:52:21,760 --> 05:52:27,904
Next all of your your values to be on like orthogonal

2372
05:52:28,160 --> 05:52:34,304
Not orthogonal bad things can have it so that's one thing that might have gone wrong

2373
05:52:34,560 --> 05:52:40,704
Actually looking at this I think it's unlikely that

2374
05:52:40,960 --> 05:52:47,104
What's what's going wrong

2375
05:53:38,560 --> 05:53:44,704
Awesome

2376
05:53:44,960 --> 05:53:51,104
Printing a good time to let us commit that and we do

2377
05:55:12,000 --> 05:55:16,352
Hey darling have you Hooked Up the chat anything yet because you totally can

2378
05:55:52,192 --> 05:55:55,008

And then I will

2380
05:56:09,600 --> 05:56:11,392
See how this goes

2381
05:56:11,904 --> 05:56:15,488
I am like always the colonel sink faltered

2382
05:56:33,920 --> 05:56:36,992
Power off icon

2383
05:56:39,040 --> 05:56:42,368
What's the temperature

2384
05:56:46,720 --> 05:56:48,000
UK

2385
05:56:49,792 --> 05:56:51,840
Survive sex

2386
05:57:13,344 --> 05:57:16,928

2387
05:57:22,048 --> 05:57:28,192
I can't do it that way I have already ordered earlier today

2388
05:57:31,264 --> 05:57:33,824
Lipo battery

2389
05:57:36,128 --> 05:57:38,944
It's already been ordered it's too late now

2390
05:58:31,936 --> 05:58:35,008
Can't really read it because it is

2391
05:58:35,520 --> 05:58:38,080
Really terribly scaled

2392
05:59:07,520 --> 05:59:13,664
Oh Mum

2393
05:59:13,920 --> 05:59:15,712
What's the time headed to do

2394
05:59:21,600 --> 05:59:27,744
This is what I intend to do

2395
05:59:50,528 --> 05:59:56,672
Do not want to be printing out the post like every frame

2396
06:00:00,512 --> 06:00:06,656
Ok so I is that

2397
06:00:06,912 --> 06:00:13,056
That's about right yet

2398
06:00:13,312 --> 06:00:19,456
Why is up

2399
06:00:19,712 --> 06:00:25,856
Wow that's weird

2400
06:00:26,112 --> 06:00:32,256
Adds no copyright

2401
06:00:32,512 --> 06:00:38,656
Oo option using the

2402
06:00:38,912 --> 06:00:45,056
Position is it say it's just a direction it's not a on like a sieve

2403
06:00:45,312 --> 06:00:51,456
Active things so for up you would want to subtract on

2404
06:01:04,512 --> 06:01:10,656
Is better ways of doing this but we're just going to do

2405
06:01:10,912 --> 06:01:17,056
Just terrible way right now

2406
06:01:23,712 --> 06:01:29,856
Can-can off

2407
06:01:30,112 --> 06:01:36,256
0 - 10

2408
06:01:36,512 --> 06:01:42,656
So the problem it's the up that wasn't funny

2409
06:01:42,912 --> 06:01:43,680
Stop it was like

2410
06:01:43,936 --> 06:01:50,080
Appoint over here where is the up is supposed to be like a vector it supposed to point in the direction

2411
06:01:50,336 --> 06:01:51,872
Supposed to be unit length

2412
06:01:58,528 --> 06:02:04,672
Lidl super wrong

2413
06:02:04,928 --> 06:02:11,072
Let's go over there and take a peek

2414
06:02:24,128 --> 06:02:30,272
As you guys can't really see it I'll bring it up next time

2415
06:02:36,928 --> 06:02:43,072
Hey well that actually looks like a pistol stop

2416
06:03:15,328 --> 06:03:21,472
Stop

2417
06:03:28,128 --> 06:03:34,272
Ok so I'm trying to work here

2418
06:03:34,528 --> 06:03:40,672
How old is Stefan just died

2419
06:03:40,928 --> 06:03:47,072
I am outside

2420
06:03:47,328 --> 06:03:53,472
So yeah

2421
06:03:53,728 --> 06:03:59,872
How long was Everything getting a use the iPlayer on screen

2422
06:04:00,128 --> 06:04:06,272
Much better refresh

2423
06:04:06,528 --> 06:04:12,672
Getting me up

2424
06:04:12,928 --> 06:04:19,072
Touch it

2425
06:04:25,728 --> 06:04:31,872
Real

2426
06:04:32,128 --> 06:04:38,272
Pause

2427
06:04:38,528 --> 06:04:44,672
Put this back together and then

2428
06:04:55,680 --> 06:05:01,824
I mean I can just hold it up to my face

2429
06:05:02,080 --> 06:05:08,224
Actually know what I want to try first

2430
06:05:08,480 --> 06:05:14,624
Like

2431
06:05:21,280 --> 06:05:25,632
Like that's what it actually looks like for me inside of there

2432
06:05:38,688 --> 06:05:44,832
It's a problem noise I think

2433
06:05:45,088 --> 06:05:51,232
Google by the way if any of you guys want to help out with life survive

2434
06:05:51,488 --> 06:05:57,632
Totally a project that needs more people

2435
06:05:57,888 --> 06:06:03,520
Yeah

2436
06:06:03,776 --> 06:06:09,920
Give me a second can you stand still don't move cosmetics

2437
06:06:10,176 --> 06:06:14,272
Is it might be a little darling let me change one thing

2438
06:06:15,808 --> 06:06:18,624
You know what would be a better place

2439
06:06:18,880 --> 06:06:24,512
Getting back off from it's the point where

2440
06:06:24,768 --> 06:06:30,912
Right now you have to get the other other lighthouse in UB40

2441
06:06:31,168 --> 06:06:37,312
Ok now the lighthouses in bewsey Nice Builder

2442
06:06:37,568 --> 06:06:43,712
Try holding your hands for their back so I can get to the yeah that works too

2443
06:06:43,968 --> 06:06:50,112
Does it feel better

2444
06:06:50,368 --> 06:06:56,512
This is working here

2445
06:06:56,768 --> 06:07:02,912
Hopton I think one day

2446
06:07:03,168 --> 06:07:09,312
With the Charles toes are still needs to be able to be seen on the first lighthouse in ordered operate so

2447
06:07:09,568 --> 06:07:13,408
Back up to the point where

2448
06:07:13,664 --> 06:07:19,808
Intersection of lines

2449
06:07:20,064 --> 06:07:26,208
Filled in landscape which was really nice

2450
06:07:26,464 --> 06:07:31,072
Like the back corner

2451
06:07:31,328 --> 06:07:37,472
Oh I see you're saying you don't like

2456
06:07:57,184 --> 06:07:59,744
GTA

That has nothing to do with this

2468
06:11:33,248 --> 06:11:39,392
Posed

2469
06:11:58,848 --> 06:12:04,992

Power

2473
06:12:24,448 --> 06:12:30,592
No I won't overlap quite as bad

As you take your right hand

2482
06:13:41,248 --> 06:13:47,392
Off and move it somewhere else you might be able to get further but not all the way

2483
06:13:47,648 --> 06:13:53,792
Am I now adjacent to the other side

2501
06:16:21,248 --> 06:16:27,392
Can the orange Pi still has 3 CPU

2502
06:16:27,648 --> 06:16:33,792
Which is absolutely mind-blowing

2503
06:16:40,448 --> 06:16:46,592
It goes

2504
06:16:46,848 --> 06:16:52,992

2505
06:16:53,248 --> 06:16:59,392
How much is a running within an hour

2506
06:17:06,048 --> 06:17:12,192
Thank you everybody for coming out tonight this is being an abscess

2507
06:17:12,448 --> 06:17:18,592
Blast on I just I'm so happy with this

06:17:18,848 --> 06:17:24,992
I hope that

2509
06:17:25,248 --> 06:17:31,392
Will get some more people contributing and we can make even more happen with lights alive

2510
06:17:38,048 --> 06:17:44,192

2511
06:17:44,448 --> 06:17:50,592
What time Jamie on the discordant give me a heads up

2512
06:17:50,848 --> 06:17:56,992
Oh yeah you want to see it with nothing wrong

2513
06:17:57,248 --> 06:18:03,392
If I kill wife survive the goes to 5.5 hundred something milliamps

2514
06:18:03,648 --> 06:18:09,792
If I kill the streamer yeah so it really doesn't use that much right now

2515
06:18:10,048 --> 06:18:16,192
Imagine once we start using the GPU a little bit heavier it's gonna start coming to get a reply

06:18:16,448 --> 06:18:22,592
