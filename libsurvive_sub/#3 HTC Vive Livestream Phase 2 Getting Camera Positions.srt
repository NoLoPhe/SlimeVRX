1
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,448
See I wonder if this is online

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,752
There it is

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,360
See does it show number of people yet is anybody in chat

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,200
Anybody anybody in chat

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
Are we live or we

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
Still hittin

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
Screen is continuing

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,976
Some reasons picking up

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,048
Elhae somebody's in chat

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,168
Do the cat reattached you have to click the fly out again oh really

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
Yeah

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
Welcome. We just disconnected OBS disconnected

13
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Okay there we go okay okay I think it's online

14
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,000
Now do you guys I have a shrink that window so we can get to the editor

15
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
Get to attract ice are we online now

16
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
Okay

17
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Get to the editor the chat window like maybe just leave it up over there something

18
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Nadia

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,224
That's weird weird setup here I've got basically figure it out

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
Yeah

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,536
Cast want to cover your screen thing

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
I don't know how many people are viewing can we see that on the other window Maybe

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
Cracked ice discount

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:49,568
Ohio case we got a couple people online where does it usually say that

25
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
That corner Maybe

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,600
To make any sense

27
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Clearly we have at least three

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
Let It Go Let It Go

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay I guess we'll probably start for realsies eowyn in five

30
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
5 minutes maybe 2 or 3 minutes

31
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Now we might as well amused by pointing out our Strange set up here

32
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,816
You can pick up the camera look around

33
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,424
We are at a cabin in the woods in Virginia don't know if you can

34
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Over there

35
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
But it's just like

36
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
An A-frame cabin

37
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Mindy's with us

38
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,600
Random people on the internet

39
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,184
Yes we've got my desktop here

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Which is hooked up to the Internet through my cell phone to somewhere under the television and providing internet

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Charles is laptop

42
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
And then Charles's laptop is VNC my desktop is via and Seed into Charles

43
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
His laptop and then my desk is doing the broadcasting and controlling the chat

44
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
Chat while Charles his laptop has been theoretically made free to do whatever the heck Charles is going to be doing

45
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,464
How do i chat in my own live stream

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
Oh hey

47
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Oh you can totally read it in okay let's see make sure you can read the others

48
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
About to get too eager at 123 what is

49
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
1231

50
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
1239

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Hell you guys okay with these levels

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
Yeah that's definitely convenient that way I don't have to keep the chat open there

53
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Let's see here so yeah we're streaming live

54
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
From the middle of a cabin in weight from a cabin in the middle of nowhere Stanardsville Virginia

55
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,319
The closest store is like 30 minutes away

56
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
Down and unpaved horrible Road and yet somehow there is still enough

57
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
Average cell coverage to stream here

58
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
So how many people are in I can't you can reverse these so that you can see that then

59
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,199
Can you cut off most of the the video thing

60
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Oh okay

61
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
No see that's not going to

62
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
Oh I see what you're getting at you just want to see

63
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
Yes

64
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
But I'll bet you can't off Dragon Windows what does that even mean

65
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Turn the window and then drag it beyond the top of the screen so like only a little ribbon oven

66
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
That works

67
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
Hi Mom are you guys just to see you know Mary Laura's my mom and

68
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,319
And she is invited her to watch this live stream

69
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
Should I stop should sleep sleep I'll watch the

70
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
Aerie my mom is watching watching the stream right now and just everybody and chat if you want to say

71
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,983
Say hi I Charles's Mom you can do that

72
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,615
My mom just you know it's only it's only nine or ten people seven people right now watching so

73
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
It's not a very big stream tonight

74
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Yet

75
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Okay

76
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
And let us know if it's getting nasty or audios cutting out to

77
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
We're not entirely sure how well this is going to hold up for long

78
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
Being a cell phone connection at all

79
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Also the other thing

80
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
I forgot was going to say now

81
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
I won't words

82
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,295
I can take anywhere since I want to be there going to be useful

83
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,743
That's interesting I wonder if because I've been streaming so much YouTube doesn't advertise it

84
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
What do you mean

85
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
Like it's less of a novelty no

86
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
Oh yeah you guys were here how did you how did you notice that the started did you like

87
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
Did you get a message on your phone that CN Laura was broadcasting or did you just see it kind of pop up on your YouTube

88
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
Feed curious how people find their way here the last

89
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,463
Tee times we had between like 40 and 90 people and people are just like us

90
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,655
Pop-up button for tweeting

91
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Is YouTube homepage so

92
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
Another HTC Vive live stream

93
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
This time

94
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,135
Trying to determine lighthouse

95
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Location

96
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Okay

97
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
I just tweeted out

98
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Ohio George

99
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,871
Is it early enough that you're going to able to stick around till about probably 12

100
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
45 I guess isn't we're going to stop today

101
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,807
The Texaco originally in the tax section YouTube cool

102
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,135
I take it by you being here right now it's

103
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
I don't remember you were in like the second one right

104
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Cold

105
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
Anyway I guess we should

106
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Mouse

107
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
It's fine acceptable

108
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
Gorgeous OK Google stream is finally set up pretty well now

109
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
I guess I can start

110
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:06,047
Okay so this is okay

111
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
Restart from here when we do the playback error the edit it and then this is where it'll actually start

112
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
Now I'm not going to clock it

113
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
So if you guys are paying attention we had some

114
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
Some fun with the dhtc Vibes Watchman controllers in the last two live streams

115
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
Trying to decode the data but this livestream isn't going to be about the coding data since it's already pretty much clear

116
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:40,095
Text what we're going to try to do is determine and I don't think this is actually going to all happen one

117
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,495
I think we can get a long way into it we're trying to determine the location of those lighthouses

118
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Relative to this headset so I'm going to do is I'm going to put this on the floor and we're going to collect some data

119
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,759
From the lighthouses and we're going to see is it possible to figure out where they are

120
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
And that really matters that's the first step to doing all of this actual localization stuff as soon as you can come

121
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Calibrate the locations of the lighthouses it becomes really not that hard to just do the rest of

122
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
The solution to figure out where objects are going around inside the main room now we're still a couple steps away from that

123
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
Not even when we have this it's going to be a while

124
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,639
But this is a pretty big step so through a lot of this I'm going to

125
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,503
What I'm going to be doing it actually Andrew Andrews my brother he's getting a PhD in math

126
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
Collecting data and I'm going to be giving it out

127
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
Two to the link in the description it's going to be on GitHub under life survive under issues we use

128
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
Adjust before but that was a bad idea what we really want to do is we want to have it in an issue and that way

129
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
Track for forever the movie taking the data and then I'm going to be putting it there and you guys can have

130
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
Pack alongside trying to do solve this problem and chances are you're going to find a better solution than I

131
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
So going back to my brother Andrew is getting a PhD in mathematics from Rutgers University so maybe I can get

132
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,279
Even temp take some of this data and try to give it a crack

133
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
The Arctic

134
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Where in the Arctic are you Frank big

135
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,495
Also can one of you guys find paper and a Sharpie for me

136
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
I got Sharpie I think there's paper in that side room

137
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
Good paper not sad paper so this is going to be a little bit more

138
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
Making heavy and math heavy than it is going to be active reverse-engineering so the first two streams were much more like doing

139
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:48,351
What is this do this is going to be much more trying to collect the data that we need and then trying

140
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,751
Analyze it thank you Mindy North Norway

141
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Hey we have somebody from North Norway it is what time is it there

142
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Perfect will you be able to see this if I hold it can you hit that light on or something

143
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
You can put it on the box and then I would light up

144
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
Then you can take the top off the light

145
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Take the top off

146
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
Oh hey perfect you'll be able to see the sheet of paper

147
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Annoying at the whole time we'll just have it on for whenever whenever

148
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,463
We actually use it I guess you guys can see that color binary counter

149
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
And are you going to be up for for doing some analysis here

150
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,263
Our first batch of data like yes if we can figure out how to get today to write maybe in as little as an hour or something

151
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
We might be able to get the data cuz I I did when I first did to the hacking of Life survive stuff

152
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
Was just more less implementing some of the stuff that the guy over at near all over

153
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Over at Lighthouse redox

154
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
What he was able to determine the document so pretty much getting pretty close on that one

155
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
By the way

156
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
And so I do regret that unless you guys understand trigonometry this is probably not going to be

157
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
All that easy to really dig into but

158
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,991
I don't really think it's going to be that much harder than than basic trigonometry

159
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,135
How would I link this to someone link youtube.com live

160
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,023
Okay so let's go a little bit into what we have here

161
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,655
So is part of a little bit here sorry about that

162
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,471
Actually series motor mount

163
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
1615

164
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
Better okay

165
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
So

166
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
I have a file here survive data. See and this is what actually gets all of the

167
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
The data from all of the different devices

168
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
And and I say devices I need anything between these guys the controllers and the

169
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,887
How to display and all of that so

170
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
That's what we're going with right now and this thing when it receives the data it then passes it up to the next

171
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Level so the very lowest level right now which we're going to be changing a little bit later but right now it's called survive

172
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,039
Add USB and this handles talking to the USB bus to get the data

173
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,367
From the actual devices at the lowest level

174
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
Survive data then processes that date of the raw B the 10 or I guess hexadecimal

175
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
The octet the date of that is coming from these devices is process it into something higher level and then survive

176
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
My process is what takes that process data and actually does something useful with it so right now inside

177
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
Side of survive light processing if you guys want you can go check out this on GitHub is it get hub.com

178
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,367
1/10 lore / live survive live survive if we found out a lot of things

179
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
We'll call it last time

180
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
At least I'm not calling it the veve right here is

181
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Survive underscore process.com

182
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:39,007
And everything that we're going to be doing today I think is going to be coming in through survive light

183
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Process

184
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
And so we have survived object which is a head-mounted display or a Watchman or I don't know I mean

185
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
Maybe there's actual light date it'll come from lighthouses I I don't know if there is or isn't a which sensor was hit

186
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
A code associated with that sensor

187
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
The time in the sweep and the time code so all of this is already decoded a little bit for us

188
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
We say time and sweep and timecode what happens is the there's the the lighthouse

189
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
House

190
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
And

191
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,735
Maybe so what we actually

192
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
Can you give me a how do I can't stay

193
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Okay so what we actually have is we have a lighthouse and the lighthouse takes a sweep

194
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
A plane of light and sweet sit across the scene

195
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
And it does this by having laser scanner that are spinning around and around and around

196
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
I need one of those things around at almost exactly 4448 millionths of a

197
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,871
The 2nd which is about 120 hertz

198
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
And

199
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:53,247
What this code here does the tell the difference between a light flash that happens

200
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
And when it actually sweeps past I think

201
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231
I don't know I haven't actually gotten updated to find out if I did that right but I will go get

202
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
Give us a shot and we'll see where we end up

203
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:13,471
Right now inside the code on all I'm doing for survive light process

204
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,799
If I'm just printing out l meaning it's a light

205
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
String which is the code name of the device ohmd or are what I call them

206
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
HED HED is the head mouth display a timecode and this is in 48

207
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
Millionths of a second so you can see it's a very large number see what it is it right now

208
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
So it's Counting

209
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
Or whatever it's counting down its assigned number so it'll go positive negative positive negative

210
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,823
But it is counting down right now we can see that it's got a light ID associate

211
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
Do with it which is actually a sensor ID on the head-mounted display and that's jumping between all sorts of

212
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,855
Different value so between light zero like 15 sorry sensor zero sensor 15

213
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
And it gives the length of the Nepal

214
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,375
The deposit code to let's go little bit into what that data looks like

215
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
The data here done by the lighthouse redox group omigosh it's amazing that they were able to figure this out

216
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
But what happens is at the beginning of of of a frame so to speak

217
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
She's actually won 120

218
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,831
If as the lighthouse actually flashes a pulse of data

219
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,695
And it's of a different lengths of time and so

220
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,047
What we actually have here is a chart of

221
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Skip's and rotors and data and in all of that and it's the time is in text

222
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Or hundred

223
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
40 million to the second

224
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:57,663
And the amount of time it was actually on so all of these Lighthouse displays going poop

225
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
And then scanning the laser scanning the other laser and then this Lighthouse over here is doing the exact

226
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
Same thing and that's how it how we can get both get data from the lighthouses and no

227
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
Know which sweep to expect so inside here inside this data we can see the flash from one light

228
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Lighthouse

229
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:23,519
Which is right here she knows it says code 10 but that case we don't get the flash numbers we get

230
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
What was the code received from Eric saying is Spencer for received

231
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Laser sweep

232
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,855
And the length of the flash associated with that laser tweet was 10

233
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
Units I'm going to have to go fix that so it it lines up with the way the lighthouse Reef

234
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
Redox folks documented it

235
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,143
But that's not going to be very hard so let's

236
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
I guess that's a good place to start so instead of having the numbers be like 8 9 10 8 9 10 76

237
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
It's whatever

238
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,151
We should probably make them something a little bit more same

239
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,039
And I think that would mean all that was really mean to starting at zero instead of something really high

240
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,487
Yeah sorry I'm going to have to

241
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:20,351
Just keep going in August maybe about 20 minutes and we'll we'll do a recap of everything

242
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
So I'm going to do is I'm going to look for survive life process in here to see what I'm actually doing with this

243
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Stata

244
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
Sucks you have a pulse if it's longer than 18 microseconds then do this

245
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,063
GLE

246
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,927
So total photo time

247
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Find my total photos oh that's another thing I forgot to mention in order to get a really accurate length of time for

248
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
For that pulse code but I'm actually doing this I'm averaging all of the lights are all the sensors that see that postcode imav

249
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,079
Averaging that length of light amongst all of them so that if it's like

250
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
We can get at the actual length of time and we can average

251
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
To figure out where the time that that pulse actually started exactly so depending on the brain

252
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
Brightness be single start triggering a little bit earlier or later but what I'm going to do an average that between all of them to find out

253
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
Where did it really start now I think about it that's probably a terrible way to do it I'll probably be looking for the first Edge

254
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
But I don't know we'll see how this all goes just some ideas thrown out there and this is Steve-O

255
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
Where we end up asking why you don't program and C plus plus

256
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Discussion okay well I will be very brief with this what

257
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
Well I mean do I want to send him the yoop is terrible video or do I want to

258
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
Specifically in this particular case we're coating this project and see to minimize

259
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:06,080
External dependencies and really get explosive Hardware as possible there is a long-term project I'm gone

260
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
Going to be trying to do here don't really want to get into what it is on but it would require the code be very

261
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,112
Very lean and I seriously do that and see and it's much harder to do that if we plus-plus

262
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,048
At any rate let's let's go do this now so I'll set time

263
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
A code a code - equals 6 + 58

264
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
Cochiti between 0 and 7 now

265
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
7412 54105

266
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
Okay are a code this column right here now looks like they might actually be lining up to the

267
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,792
The lighthouse people

268
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
No this is not this is not for the the hackaday 1 KB challenge

269
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
Actually I'm checking out of that not doing it because someone has already somebody has effectively won the

270
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,688
Add hacked A1 KB challenge if you haven't seen it

271
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
Iowan TV challenge with the one

272
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,648
If my computer loads it at all

273
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
There is there's already been a submission that I'm sure there are other people who can beat this

274
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
Submission but I can't in so I'm just I'll keep supporting and whatever way but that's way out of my

275
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
My way out of my league somebody made an entire operating system that fits in one kill

276
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
KB and it's it's pretty functional

277
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,808
Bi was actually very crazy functional

278
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
The

279
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
Okay OS

280
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
Somebody made actual operating system with a text editor and it can compile programs assembly

281
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:09,984
Programs and it can save files like a compiled to file and you can run the program

282
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,616
And it works and it has like a font in the display and everything so these folks

283
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:22,016
Yeah I'm not going to try to compete against that backpack to the

284
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:28,416
So we have L meaningful light we have had meaning it's to the Head mouth display

285
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
We have this year which is a timecode in absolute terms of when the The Sweep actually

286
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
Hit the light and I think that's actually what we have I don't know whether it's like Leading Edge your trailing Edge

287
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,032
We're getting from the address for Lighthouse data

288
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
The code

289
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,480
Which is able you can look that up right here on the lighthouse redox and the

290
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,856
The the time within that sweet that that could happen

291
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,440
So I guess one thing we can start with here

292
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
Just so you guys can get a feeling for how amazing this Lighthouse beta is what I'm going to do

293
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
I do

294
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Is

295
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,984
Going to put a prefix in front so we can actually like identify it

296
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,896
Crapsey 40K

297
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
So what I have is I'm looking at a specific piece of data during a sweet and

298
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,624
And so I'm going to move the the the headset display

299
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
And you can see Elias that's vertical

300
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,304
And you can see just a little bit of motion

301
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
How different the data can be

302
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
So just by moving a few inches

303
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,472
Even with the lighthouse all the way over there

304
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
That can add up incredibly like just the date is very very stable and even just a little bit of

305
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:58,272
Motion gives you very high fidelity it's the what's going on that's one of the reasons I believe that this is just

306
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
The future because instead of a camera or you get like a certain number of pixels by certain number of pixels pixels of act

307
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
This thing can tell you to Within

308
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
360 / 48 / 124

309
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
Aoo 0.08 locate it's about 0

310
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,272
0.001 degrees of angle so if you treat like the

311
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Lighthouse like a clock

312
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,952
Add a sweeping that light around it can tell you where that light hit that that the sensor

313
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
2 resolution

314
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
Of 0.00

315
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:49,216
1 degrees now it's not accuracy of 0.001 degrees it's a little bit less accurate

316
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:55,616
But it's still unbelievably good versus something like a camera solution which

317
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
That is what a curious uses right really funny camera at you and you track

318
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,416
It totally works that way

319
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
Better

320
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
So I'm guessing you guys may want to get your hands on some of the state of right

321
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
Although you won't be able to do that much with it other than create some pretty pictures I guess that's

322
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,336
I'll do first is I'll take some data for you guys

323
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
And then you can at least take a look at it and I remove the sea

324
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
So that it doesn't get in the way there

325
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,344
And initial hmd data.

326
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Txt

327
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Nope not yet

328
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,768
Do you guys want spaces or commas

329
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Like

330
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,656
Like it with your data like if you were going to analyze stuff

331
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
Do you want to

332
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
Like Analyze That using spaces between the data or commas between the data like everybody's religious about

333
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
About this but I don't really care

334
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:07,808
So what you guys tell me if you want spaces are commas I'll go take a log file for y'all

335
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Either or

336
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
Pick one and go

337
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,536
Subway Surfers

338
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,496
Camas Mindy suggest

339
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,824
Have no we're not doing tab

340
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Okay

341
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,968
234

342
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,784
SSV o space

343
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
But I can do that part for you if you want okay well

344
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,792
That's probably enough data to be your assistant

345
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,936
Let's see how much data that is 765 KB in data

346
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Look at all that data

347
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,872
Okay I see how we need to do is we need to

348
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,456
Delete this last line right here

349
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,040
Okay I'm not a zip this up

350
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,976
76% compression

351
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:26,656
You can't quite a cheap Benz level of compression for those of you

352
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
Hi to miss the last livestream the compression that's done on the data from these things 1

353
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
MB of data spent sent in 12 seconds that 1 MB if I compress it with gzip which is a really

354
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,784
Leaving compression algorithm it goes to 96 GB

355
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,880
The stream that been the guy who wrote this his algorithm

356
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
It gets it to 69kg be so he's able to compress better than when you believe is the best

357
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
It's amazing because he cheats

358
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:04,800
Okay so I'm going to go upload this right now so you guys can get a better

359
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Do you think I don't know

360
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
Rico Rico can you explain if you're being legitimate with the commas compress better cuz I've never

361
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
Heard of that might be true

362
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,720
How do I upload a file to GitHub an issue

363
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,352
Boy how does that work

364
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Oh you know it

365
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,424
Attach files by dragging and dropping

366
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,288
Initial hmd.

367
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,592
Something.

368
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,456
C4 versions of the chat here he's really weird

369
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
Compresses 2182 KB show us being on the cell phone connections we are that's okay

370
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
Does you guys missed it the reason I'm doing this project is because I ran out of data on my cell phone why didn't completely run

371
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Would like

372
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
I was using a ton of data

373
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,936
Trying to get all the dependencies for the open

374
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592
Guests open Notes VR stuff for the the Vive ridiculous existing

375
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
So

376
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
This is some initial data

377
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Yes

378
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
Columns are

379
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,816
Charles has to talk out loud while he types otherwise I can't type it makes working in a professional environment

380
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
Very strange

381
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
L head

382
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
And then we're going to do

383
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Actual

384
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
Time

385
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
148

386
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
No

387
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
Of a second

388
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
,

389
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,832
Sensor ID

390
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
,

391
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
Pulse

392
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Code

393
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
,

394
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,792
Delta from frames start

395
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:09,216
Okay guys if you guys want to go get that and download it and start poking around and read it into your favorite viewers

396
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
Now is the time to do it

397
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,128
So what did he say Taps depressed most Dragon dropping upload was it supposed to say

398
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,944
Did he ever tell us why commas compress better

399
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
I did not say

400
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,784
Oh he says spaces compress better

401
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
So if I don't do, and Stacy is correct

402
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,488
If it's just a sore just, but I did, and a space so

403
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
Actually your your period is more than

404
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
One pixel on our screen yeah we have a really bizarre screen layout so that'll happen

405
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,992
Count the spaces no I'm not going to take out the spaces to some people are going to be using see to read it

406
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,904
Bonus points if you see Derita you can probably just open it up in like Notepad

407
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,488
Find replace also

408
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
Anyway that's uploaded the next part that we have to worry about is getting the calibration data

409
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
So I can say that we just slept across sensor number 7 but that's completely meaningless to you

410
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,688
But we can get a lot further if I say I took the cross sensor number 7 and its current location

411
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:28,064
Yes here wherever here is or 8 is here at 9 is here

412
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,184
And we have unfortunately wipe the config data for our Vive

413
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
But Fox something Dev was nice enough to give us his but it is an older V

414
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,936
By the way if anybody watching right now has the Thanksgiving Vive

415
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
If you can please please get us your config file so I can try to get a config that's closer to my

416
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
505

417
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,760
Yet so you going to explain how to do that to it's the lighthouse underscore console light

418
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Underscore console exe is buried somewhere deep within the files that were installed when you install

419
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,560
Revive everything and you can type help and find a whole list of things and you

420
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
I think the command is like download config space some file name make it up

421
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
And then like she pull a copy of the config file which has the physical positions of a

422
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:30,016
Everything off and save it as a bin or something like that and then you can email that and that would be

423
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:33,600
Post a link in the

424
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
In the description description I can't do that

425
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:46,400
Don't go find the link on Twitter or on Reddit and then posted in the 20

426
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,800
You want it do you want it in the description Michael descriptionmichael specifically if you have the

427
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:59,200
Config for the Vive where this cable right here is one cable instead of three separate

428
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
That's the end

429
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
Your differences that I know of three-in-one table instead of having three separate cables that got 19

430
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:17,632
Nice low diameter flexible cable and they came with really good

431
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
Wrist straps because everyone was buying out all of the the Wii wrist straps for this parenting

432
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
And I was sold out for a while

433
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
What is happening

434
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
The five is happening

435
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,160
Remember what exactly

436
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,256
Oh yeah here to survive get config

437
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
Okay so the way I blew away my config

438
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
Was I Will Survive get config when I wrote it I totally wrote it wrong and what I asked

439
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
Play ended up doing

440
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,616
See if I can find it

441
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
Is I said he'd get feature report time out and then he get Beach Report I'm out I have

442
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
Had this set the set update feature report instead of get update feature report what it actually did was just

443
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Bluewave very first 64 X2 Mike intake Destructor which is Jesus so there's no way to reach

444
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,400
Cover the contagious scripture my config scripture was completely blown

445
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,496
And as far as I'm aware they don't keep it around the factory

446
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
I think Ben Ben Jackson the guy who wrote that this algorithm was kind of star

447
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
Are the show the last two times I think he asked the factory Ford but totally did not

448
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,624
Did not work description Charles yes

449
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,000
Just say like itchy

450
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay so I'm going to make sure that I'm not setting the

451
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:02,080
The the token here I'm only going to be getting for this one so

452
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,384
Update feature report

453
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,784
Get update feature report and its control class

454
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,904
Direction is in and when it says in it means into the computer

455
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,304
Instead of out from the computer so that means that if I run this code it's not going to blow

456
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
Descriptor again

457
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
Not that we don't already have a temporary one that we put in place from the fox guy

458
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,616
Enable getting the descriptor and we'll see if we can pull it

459
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:42,016
Cancel it that's cool I'm going to be posting my config descriptor which is kind of close to what we have but not

460
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:48,416
Exactly which by the way even if it was we do get one from the Thanksgiving it's still going to have some

461
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,816
Very minor manufacturing differences in so far as like the exact location of all of photodiode

462
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:01,216
So there's no way to get it perfect

463
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:07,616
Microns

464
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:13,248
Send it to you just post in the throat

465
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,552
Nopat in the Reddit thread

466
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
Write wishing you had made the Reddit thread

467
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
Sending it to see okay

468
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:33,216
No I don't want to email there it just posted in the thread and then we'll

469
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
Arrange the habit

470
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
The Reddit thread

471
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,736
I will show you what this config is like in a moment this will be the first time I've tried run

472
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
Running the getting config on this thing since we started I hope it doesn't explode

473
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
Okay mate

474
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,544
Too much data from packet for config for device 00

475
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
8729

476
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,552
That's right

477
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
Tails try 01 Udall

478
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:39,520
Could not get survived data I'm case that didn't work let's try 10

479
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,848
Hey something happened

480
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,712
Hack what does tag mean something else

481
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
Okay that actually looks really promising what it says it got config data length 34:8

482
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
83 which is probably about right because what actually happens is there's a big config file what you guys will cease

483
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
The back of coffee

484
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
The wrong one

485
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
And

486
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
They they cheese if it's impressive so it fits inside some memory in there and then when they download it like

487
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,040
Whenever the valve VR software downloads it and just expansive

488
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,632
Expands it and the size 16649 looks like it might be

489
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:44,032
About right so let's see here make sure I didn't do some

490
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,568
Kind of silly dumb

491
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,664
Print out the size and the pointer to it

492
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,808
Boom

493
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:00,160
That looks like it's a pointer but that does not look like the right data

494
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
Set 20

495
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
No okay

496
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
That's an interesting thing there's one annoying thing about sea

497
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,752
If you don't Define a variable and it's on your stack it can be random

498
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:21,152
So if you ever worry about that always set your variables 20 or some known value

499
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
Don't leave them uninitialized

500
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,808
So I decided to zero and indeed it does not get updated

501
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,184
What the tag dileo's about

502
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,376
Survive USB tag

503
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,503
Okay 16649 Neal why is that returning Neil

504
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,879
Got config dataline 3043

505
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
Now we know we're getting here

506
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
I'm making a new buffer

507
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,591
Stark Stark and 20

508
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,687
So I guess I passed in a double star into dysfunction

509
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
Almond what that means is the pointer to a flanker and what I need to do is update that pointer so that when I'm out here

510
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,903
That is I can just

511
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,463
Passing a pointer to my pointer

512
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
And then it will update this value with the right value

513
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
Gorgeous gorgeous we can now read a config file from the Vai

514
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
5 headset, so what this would mean is if you were to go use live survive you would be able to read your config file

515
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,503
The state has not yet parsed so we're going to have to do some parsing on it before we can make it useful

516
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,815
Are we going to parse it I did a little bit of checking out things ahead of time

517
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:20,191
And I didn't really do much in the CD redist folder

518
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,543
I actually already had a copy of the config that we put on it

519
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:29,663
Test. Config bomb if you want to see what a config file looks like

520
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
You can actually check into GitHub repository so I'm not posting likes the things

521
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
Things that are into GitHub

522
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,951
I'm so if you visit github.com seeing Laura slide survive

523
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
Inside here

524
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,863
We can then look in the

525
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
I never committed it

526
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:14,207
So there's a really small that I just found a simple Google search might be the best might not be the best if you guys know

527
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:18,047
Better tell me

528
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
Easley parsaei TR

529
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:25,215
ER but yes specifically I am trying jsmn

530
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
Is my audio wrong like when I talk

531
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,247
Is this laggy for you

532
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,903
Like it's my voice not does my mouth match my voice

533
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,511
That's a good way to do it that's not as dumb

534
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,911
Yes I'm actually going to try Jasmine that was just the first one that I found

535
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,751
People already

536
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,799
Tilawah

537
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:07,199
I'm going to be using Jasmine or Jasmine is licensed under the MIT X11 license so I can use it with

538
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:13,599
I've survived which is also license under the MIT X11 license the reason behind this is that we

539
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,975
Do want live survive to be able to be used in commercial products so whether or not we will or won't

540
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
But being able to have it license is a really important thing

541
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,703
I'm going to go push test

542
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,359
You sure can't see my password right

543
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
Good okay so now it's been pushed

544
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,951
I'm so now under the Regis folder there's a file called test. Config I just so you guys know this is the one

545
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
Already had as an example one but what I'll be doing is I'll be trying to do this with the

546
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,167
The one that's built into my headset

547
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,287
Which is actually just another copy this file so whatever

548
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,383
At any rate the way this works survive get config

549
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
Is it

550
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,783
Runs and actually the Stalls were coming get rid of these notes that are wrong

551
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,951
Is it it reads the speed Beach report a bunch of times and then it gets all of the Jesus

552
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,351
Compressed data and then I use inflate in order to fill out the rest of the thing so there is another

553
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
Dependency that I have now

554
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,959
And that is zlide but

555
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:39,359
Considering virtually all systems have some form of zlide decompression

556
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
This should be fine

557
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:46,783
It's not going to be like one of those 500 MB map packages or anything

558
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
Maple

559
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:57,023
Call knowing what is it again in Linux is equivalent and it's just like it makes that sound

560
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,423
Uncompressed eating up your precious hard drive

561
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,983
So let's see

562
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
I'm going to

563
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
Edit open at config a totally open I can look at it everything's fine so whatever

564
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831
She tried doing is parsing it using Jasmine so I guess I'll have to make a new thing

565
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
Laying here

566
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
You know what heck I'll do it right here

567
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,455
Make sure that the return values will will actually make sense return -5

568
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
-4 - 2 - 12 those are all negative values that means that

569
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:59,487
If it fails and will return and negative value if it succeeds it'll be a positive value with the number of fights

570
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
My cat says little person called pup I know puff is awesome

571
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
Nazi is just great because you can totally run that on like an 80 are it's actually optimized

572
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:20,735
Totally runs unlike 8-bit microcontrollers it's it's great I love Bob

573
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,511
Are you sure

574
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,327
Frank who has an opinion about what

575
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,911
A way to view the Jason's famous nice to meet you to see

576
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
At any rate

577
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
I'm moving on so right now if I have a config and all is fine and we'll do this else

578
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
Return 0 if it fails

579
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
Okay so if it passes now and here we can then print out the

580
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,207
The data that we have to make sure it's still good ct0 Khan

581
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,279
And make sure that all is well with the world

582
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
It's not what I wanted

583
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,239
Y'all want to do right now is I don't want to print out

584
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:52,639
The Lighthouse State so yes I can print that out and it totally Prince it so I now know that I have the Jays

585
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,039
Sandra's coming from the headset so if you want to try out a copy of Life survive on your Linux OS X or even

586
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:05,439
Probably maybe Windows if you have allied with the filter installed that would be really awkward because

587
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:10,047
Both valve and this thing would want to talk to the Vive which should be

588
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,887
Weird

589
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:20,543
Eric the OS X server Linux let's stick to that for right now then you total

590
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
So right now in survive. C.l. reading the JS file

591
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,575
Let's take a look at the in the sample Jazz file that comes with the sweet

592
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
So the the config files contain a lot of data about the accelerometers and

593
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
And the gyro

594
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:48,447
I say a lot of day by really mean to bias so that means at resting position for the all of the three orientations for the head

595
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847
What is the 0 for the accelerometer and this is

596
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,199
Important cuz otherwise it'll think that it's going to be drifting one way or the other

597
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
I'm Elias if you own any furniture cuz you're always doing it on the floor furniture

598
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:12,255
Address for Chumps yeah about that no we have plenty of furniture here but it's just difficult to do

599
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,559
A livestream with furniture

600
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:21,471
Anyway

601
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
Just

602
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:28,383
If you know what is it bothering you

603
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,831
The fables the internal everything that's said I don't understand what George's

604
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
Fang

605
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:46,047
Any rate the accelerometer and the gyro and all of that stuff is calibrated here and considering.

606
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:52,447
Accelerometer basis bias for a fox's headset was negative or positive

607
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:58,847
1572 is 15% off 0 which I have a hard time believing that are

608
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:05,247
Headsets that bad but we're not going to go to calibrate our headset today although I do

609
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:11,135
Like to calibrate our headsets soon not going to be able to do that right now

610
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:18,047
It contains a lot of information about the the eyes and how that's all set up it contains

611
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
So references to these files which I don't really understand what it is but if

612
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
If you use these files

613
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,663
When you update it for your particular Vive I totally works so like when we receive foxes

614
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:40,063
The headset his config we had to update it with this configs

615
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,463
Amora analyzes that MC files which we were able to find an atom's computer so thankfully that didn't get blown away

616
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:51,071
And then here is the important part for today

617
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,143
Under Lighthouse config there the Channel map

618
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,751
And inside the channel nap or after the channel Map There's model normals

619
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:04,383
I personally don't know how to use right now but the most important thing

620
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
Is this right here

621
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
Model points not imagine model normal could be used to like throw something out that you know

622
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,743
Does bad like if you're getting a reflection from that Lighthouse off that wall and it's hitting it or something like you know you can throw it

623
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
Like

624
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,423
It's pointed in the wrong direction but I'm not going to deal with that right now that's hard

625
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,823
What I care about the hardware needed for calibrating I think it just needs the sauce the right song

626
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,223
Yeah I don't know people are saying if I had the hdk that's okay but I would have to execute a non-disclosure agreement

627
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,015
Valve

628
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:48,415
About that and I'm not not going to do that because I still want to be able to work on all of this and give away all

629
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,815
All of the information I find another person quite a while ago said you should really just return the Vive and get a new one

630
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
I has we should I knew enough to know about that

631
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,335
The cool kid hey Mom

632
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:12,735
Yes this is going to be technical I'm sorry Mom

633
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:19,135
I think Dad might understand a bit of it but it is it is very

634
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:23,487
Very subject specific material

635
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:31,679
Anyway moving on this this file right here contains the config file contains all of these points

636
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
How many Star points relative to the center of the headset which I think is

637
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:44,479
Is right here but I don't know for sure I haven't actually plotted these yet I haven't looked at it yet but I'm going to go Parsi

638
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,759
Please I'm going to dump out

639
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:51,391
PSV for you guys so you can easily import these data points

640
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,815
And once it was a habit that way I'll be able to load it into life survived they rate the idea is that by having the state

641
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:05,215
File I can know exactly where each one of these thoughts on the vibe is

642
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
And what I can do is I can then correlate the sweet times and all of that to this guy that's all hopes and

643
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,015
I don't know if it's kind of work yet so I guess what I should probably do first is try

644
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
Try to extract from this config file right here the the date of the XYZ

645
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:29,279
The XYZ the XYZ

646
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,351
To test. Config. Jason

647
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:38,751
I'll rename it to test. Config. Chaisson

648
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,863
Too late he's already doing it Alvin

649
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
You've Won

650
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
Dawn

651
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,615
Been there too late Don

652
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
Okay

653
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:23,295
And so I'm going to see if I can parse that that day to help now I admit I have done a little bit of prep

654
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,599
At work so in the general folder

655
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:31,999
Sorry in the weirdest folder I do have a copy of Jasmine. H and Jasmine.

656
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:38,399
And Justin was again just a parcel I found by just quickly Googling and I wanted

657
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:44,799
Obviously Google minimalistic C Json parser and the answer is

658
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:51,199
Five libraries that are to open up these Json files and then there's this one

659
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:56,063
Which was 315 lines law which

660
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
Is like

661
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,743
An order of magnitude smaller than any of the others so I'm going to use this one

662
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,815
It would be that way

663
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
Code is

664
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,423
Over there

665
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,567
So I have

666
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,895
Mindy feel free to ask questions

667
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
What what

668
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:28,319
If you have any questions or anyting yeah if you're too

669
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,511
Do you know Ryan

670
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:41,887
I don't know if I knew Hydra cut

671
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:47,519
I just don't know that particular okay

672
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,223
How can you add some fire to the wood to the fire

673
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:02,623
Anybody knows it what time in the last livestream I said I am just a midget on the Giants of sheol

674
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,023
Holder's I'd love to know when because I can't believe I said that that long I don't know who Steven is

675
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:18,495
Who's to Steven's mom Steven

676
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,455
BK Tuesday

677
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:32,319
Let's see if I already have open scad I'll do it if I don't

678
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:38,463
I'm not I'm I'm I understand right now I'm not on a limited data plan but

679
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,535
Oh no let's look at them curious how big is it

680
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
Open up in this one speed right now

681
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:59,967
Oh that's actually really small small small I have

682
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,295
I barely have an excuse not to use open scad

683
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:07,647
I'm not familiar with it but I'll get it in case

684
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,303
Who don't know DK Tuesday is one of the other Developers for the HTC Vive

685
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
He kind of Hopsin last time I didn't know who was for a long time there was a bit of a joke

686
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
Nevada

687
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:28,127
That Ben was like Charles still hasn't figured out that he's Alan Yates

688
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,223
So high Alan

689
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:39,647
Are a time to go through additionally some the homework I did before was I downloaded the

690
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:45,535
Example test program of how to open up these config files in JSON sartin Jasmine

691
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:51,935
And I started poking with that so I'm going to just basically copy and paste wholesale

692
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,239
That example into

693
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:59,103
What I'm doing yeah dude look it's so slow here the Internet is just

694
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,943
I don't know how or streaming right now that's what's using all the bandwidth

695
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:08,575
12:00 12:00 kb per second of the bandwidth

696
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
Okay

697
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
So in here

698
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:18,815
Instantiate a new Jasmine parser give it a bunch of space

699
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:25,215
Passing instead of Json string it's going to be ct0 Khan and Len

700
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:31,615
Party was landfill well this code is basically directly

701
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
From the Jasmine example

702
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:43,903
And I'm going to say if it did not work failed to parse Json

703
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
Abort

704
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:51,839
Did work but something was wrong object expected actual choose the right

705
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
Right

706
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,447
The right error codes

707
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,095
Frank had a few questions when you have time

708
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,935
Franklin oh

709
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:35,359
Does the lighthouse export 32 raisin the plane cuz this 32 points in the lighthouse config with both points and normal

710
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,759
Which could probably be used to extrapolate that to raise and therefore the lighthouse position

711
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
My goal is to be able to use the Physicians of lighthouses or not

712
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:54,559
Positions of the lighthouses but to Define this headset as being 00 the origin

713
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,631
And be able to figure out where the lighthouses are

714
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,959
Based on where this headset is

715
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
I'm not a math guy

716
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
I'm hoping you guys will be Spartan figure this one out too but I'm going to give it a shot cuz I have an idea as to how I want to try

717
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,711
Try to do it

718
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:18,111
Okay Tuesday here says when we publish all the lighthouse implementer course

719
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,695
Info that will be included

720
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,255
Okay well

721
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:31,423
I'm still not going to be signing that NDA right now like I don't think I will or whatever the steam

722
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:36,031
The click-through license for the HD queso

723
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:39,359
I don't think I will have access to that

724
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,527
I am actually camping we are camping at my parent's cabin my mom is in the chat right now

725
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,599
Their cabin in the middle of the woods so

726
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,231
That be too convenient

727
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,631
You could pick it up though unlike look around do you want to win when you're done even packed

728
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:10,847
Well I was a kitchen like you could like pigs

729
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,175
Video with my camera I can play it back but that's about all I can really do

730
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:20,831
We just got to balance the camera on top of the couch right now it's Terry if you want you can totally take video

731
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:25,695
Like we get to slope one and play the video

732
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,303
Kevin Hart

733
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,375
Kevin hack oh yeah cabin hack

734
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:40,287
There was some joke about trying to take the stream out at the on the on the trails and hiking around but I did

735
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
Just don't know how he would do that right now we have a really convoluted streaming setup right now

736
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,015
I will not be going

737
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
If I'm lucky I'm not going to be going back to Rochester ever sorry

738
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,791
At any rate

739
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,423
Broadcast

740
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:15,359
Sitting rate what happened is I I look at the Json object that are being returned by Jasmine

741
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:21,759
And then I look at the first one make sure it's the right kind of objects just object which means it's like a

742
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
An unnamed thing and I'm going to eat a rate as it again this is just example code straight up from Jasmine

743
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
And I just tweaked a little bit of it I'm going to iterate over all of the things inside of the Json file looking for Mom

744
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:40,959
Model points and once I find that I'll try extracting its Data Tracking

745
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:45,311
Track deck

746
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:53,759
Okay got that

747
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
Here

748
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,903
But pretty this up some since it does not need to look terrible anymore

749
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:13,471
Okay now looks for model points and prints them out let's give a shot

750
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
And see if this thing will

751
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
Bull Run

752
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,663

753
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,783

755
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:38,303
And I owe you know it's not party Jasmine stringless part of pt0 conf

756
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,567
Oh you know what I forgot to include Jasmine

757
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:03,135
I'm looking I'm trying to find where

758
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,951

01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,495
Okay one more are left or one more warning which I'm going to treat as an error because I don't want

775
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
Have things get all broken

776
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
You've compiled

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,183
I liked it's something what to do I print it out the

778
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863

So

780
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,263

01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,567
Auralex Jasmine number

782
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,455

I haven't seen any argentinians today

794
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,663
For keeping your mom busy Charles

795
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,759
What did she say that

01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
Don't see anything for my mom

799
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,143
What did you get to see how long she would

800
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,007
No we did not place that's to see how long my mom would stick around for that would be mean

801
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
Okay back to work

802
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
Let us Just Turkey

815
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:45,247
Okay so Jasmine is kind of a cool way that it parses JavaScript are straight-up script

816
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:51,647
Parks is Json files because he just read through it and they do look kind of like as it's going it'll produce this

817
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:58,047
Table and and 12 tables all said and done all that actually stories is pointers to where

818
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:04,447
Are the different tags and different things live so offer anyone tag like say I'm looking at

819
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,007
Specific

820
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
A specific things like under reduced under test. Kindig. Jason if I'm looking at

821
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:17,247
Say this particular value right here

822
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:23,647
He tells me where the first character of it is and the last character of it is that way I can just go look to it and

823
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,231
Read it out and it doesn't have to keep copies of all of this junk around

824
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:33,119
But it does mean it's a little bit awkward cuz I have to go copy the string out and some other stuff

825
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:37,727

Let's see what the state of looks like

829
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,295
Broken why is it broken

830
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:08,191

832
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:20,223
Mom I will be uploading this video of but I am going to edit out the first part when we start the Stream

833
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:24,831
Other than that unless something happens during the stream that would be

834
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:30,975
Major whatever I generally I think I'm going to be uploading the streams as is

835
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:41,983
Did you say something else I think you can totally chat with these people about

836
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:48,383
Anything you want that's the fun instead it's it's called a live if it's a live event so it's

837
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
It's like people can actually get together and just chat and talk about you know both this and everything from all over around

838
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:01,183
Somebody says line 96 hydrocat

839
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,023
You just save me five minutes

840
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,775
Bingo all thanks hydrocat okay so now we got all the data

841
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,455
I don't know if that's the right number of elements so it doesn't look right

842
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,351
That's right I mean it looks right it's got

843
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,959
Starting it 20 and going all the way off its

844
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
Got the right around

845
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,103
Which point in reference as a lighthouse coordinates to

846
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:57,247
What do you mean that's just what Frank is a star

847
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:03,647
Meli Meli

848
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:10,047
These are not Lighthouse coordinates yet these I'm right now just trying to read out from the head not the

849
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:16,447
Display the location of all of these dots relative to its sweeping Crossings

850
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,727
Basically a Time

851
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:24,127
That's what the data that's on GitHub gives you the time that it's at inactive

852
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:30,527
Write it down on a piece of paper for the

853
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:36,927
Team effort here thank you

854
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,327
Give me a second

855
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,399
Exynos 400,000

856
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,215
To get you a whiteboard

857
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:55,615
That big like camera pointing down that would be

858
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:02,015
I can hang this one from the ceiling yeah but I can't zoom in on the turn on the light

859
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:08,415
Okay so what we actually have like data is it's done with these lasers that sweep around and around in a

860
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
Around 360 degrees just around around around and it takes 400

861
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:21,215
Thousand tix4tonight of 360° so one of the things that we were marveling at at my house

862
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:27,615
Is the fact that if you're in the center of the of lighthouses point-of-view like the

863
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:34,015
Put the dead centerforce looking down here and your object is right here then it's exactly 200,000 ticks

864
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:40,415
And we were just like wow those valve people they like their round numbers that's really awesome but

865
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:46,815
It's actually really cool because it it it just happens to line up that way this is just for

866
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:53,215
1006 all the way around because it's one sorry all the way around

867
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:59,615
121 120th of the second so all of the the laser scanners are operating at 8

868
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:06,015
Exactly fit exactly 120 hertz and they're all like phase-locked

869
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:10,367
So there are all each one is I guess the

870
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:16,767
Can each Lighthouse the one laser scanner spinning around is exactly 180

871
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:23,167
Degrees out of phase with the other one I think you're right I think so I think it's 188

872
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:27,263
Don't think it's like 90 90 90 90

873
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,639
That's probably right I don't actually know for sure that what if it was just spinning slower to see

874
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:36,479
This one goes 90 and then this one goes 90

875
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:42,111
Anybody who's more familiar with this they might know for sure if it's actually 90 90 90 90

876
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,439
Or if it's 180 180 180 180

877
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
Does it make a difference

878
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
Jupiter at least right now we're trying to do this to find the locations of the lighthouses so that we can

879
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,311
Then figure out the location of objects within the vibes point-of-view

880
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:08,479
And he's doing this without using the existing libraries for communicating with the vibe

881
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,783
Because he wants to basically

882
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:17,183
I don't know how the lighthouses communicate through each other I do know that there is a developer

883
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,231
Currently in chat who with

884
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:25,631
He would like to say something about that he totally can but that is actually

885
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:31,519
Be of no concern to any of my goals so

886
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:37,919
They have two house would they they stay in perfect sync with each other

887
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
Osprey Point

888
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:48,415
I didn't think about that maybe they they are dumb says that

889
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:55,071
Use RF okay it just directly between and light pulses

890
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:01,471
Another interesting one is the lighthouse redox people were able to find out that

891
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:07,871
The flashes that they give are specially coated neither one and zero in the data domain

892
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:14,271
And they make up a list other interesting packet in

893
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:17,855
Has a thing about that on chat right now

894
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,791
Mills is Mills has his explanation is

895
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Did the

896
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:33,215
Oh nevermind I thought you were the guy who did the lighthouse redox I was going to be like super excited

897
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:39,615
I show the lighthouse on the camera here

898
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:43,711
See here the camera corrected

899
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:48,319
Say what

900
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:54,719
I specifically I'm trying to not get in

901
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:59,327
Situation right to sign in the nda's or anything like that hey you can kind of see it

902
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,143
I'll go the other side has power in the back

903
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,567
Oh hey that's really cool

904
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:14,687
It is not helping little bit of the structure in there

905
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:19,551
Yeah so what you actually can see is the laser scanner across the bottom

906
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:23,391
That kind of follows the camera from left to right

907
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,767
And the laser scanner on the right that follows it top we talked about like

908
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,095
Keep this little

909
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:38,495
Sitting here versus that little thing down there not the big bag of Lights bright

910
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:44,127
Flashes to synchronize everything the bottom one is the one that scanning left to right

911
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,431
Says you see like if I'm all the way over here

912
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:53,087
Can you see normally can't see through

913
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:58,975
The camera like this you can kinda sort of this again

914
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:02,303
Yeah I know the lighthouses are so elegant

915
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,095
It's really nice

916
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:11,519
Could you guys hear me clearly

917
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:18,688
The lighthouse as far as I know oh yeah there you go Arnie give you the answer

918
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,344
Sorry I think you guys are starting to see why I think the five is so cool

919
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:31,744
Sorry

920
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,144
Down here and keep coating so right now we are going to have to Parts this data and get it

921
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,544
Endolite survive and I'm going to go export that so that you guys can have both the timer

922
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
Data and the position data that I'll be playing with oh my gosh we already an hour

923
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
And a half in

924
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:58,112
Store. Okay

925
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:04,512
Fun with this rate I was hoping to be further along

926
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,096
Been a lot of sidetracks makes me sad

927
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:15,008
So I'm going to have to open survive Eternal. H

928
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,616
And I'm going to have to add to the objects

929
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:25,248
By the way one of the chips that I'm going to be using in conjunction with this

930
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:31,648
Is the esp32 and from what I can tell it actually does have floating-point support so you

931
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:36,256
Even though valve has been very careful to use doubles from what I can tell everywhere

932
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
I sure will do

933
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,352
Maybe I'll make it so could be doubles or floats

934
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:48,288
Sure let's do that to give everything away

935
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,152
Gave most of it away

936
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,224
My mom wants to know in one sentence what this is about

937
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:03,904
Figuring out how to do all of the Vibes backend stuff yourself

938
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
On a bad computer

939
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:10,816
I want at all

940
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,608
I want to

941
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:19,264
Valency by myself but like without using

942
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,848
The people who made the Vive stuff

943
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,200
Make the Vive work on really slow computer

944
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
Is that a sentence

945
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:35,392
I think I mean I think they're still wondering why do you why do you want to work on a computer

946
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:40,256
Number one I have a really old laptop

947
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,072
I want to use the bike with it

948
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:49,728
And by the way we do have access to like a really fast Windows computer right here but I want to get at work on my laptop

949
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,824
And number two because I have this grand plan

950
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,688
Of also using an esp32 with assistant

951
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:02,784
Esp32 from espresso

952
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,648
Do you guys have some ideas I don't actually have a solid plan yet

953
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,464
I talked to Tina mobile

954
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:18,656
Okay so basically I'm going to be

955
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,752
Doing BR things with the VR headset

956
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:28,896
Fast and without the help without using the stuff that the people who made the VR headset

957
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,432
Made

958
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:37,088
Sort of like I'm still using the headset but I'm using all the firmware they put into that you give it up okay

959
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,904
I'm sorry it's so hard to explain

960
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:45,024
Why wouldn't balvir htc desire

961
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:50,912
I don't know how they work internally they very well might be able to do this way faster than me

962
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,192
But

963
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,544
I don't go into situations

964
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,688
Assuming I'm never going to be able to do anything cool because I was going to go into situations and see what happens

965
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,344
At any rate

966
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,392
A lot about cosmetics

967
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
Right

968
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,696
Frank

969
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:20,096
Really cool looking things do you need a really high-end computer to render the really awesome

970
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:26,496
Graphics and interact with it right and no

971
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:32,896
Something that kids like look like a horrible Atari game

972
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,200
And from the ground up

973
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:42,880
And also one of the other side effects of that is many times when you do get something that's super fast and really lightweight

974
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:48,768
Then everything else benefits because parts and pits of parts and pieces of it can be used to really

975
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:56,448
Make it run faster for everyone just provide light

976
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:02,848
They are the things that receive the light and they

977
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:09,248
Measure exactly when it comes through in the light comes at a very regular interval and

978
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:13,600
They can do math to basically figure out where they are based upon what

979
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,648
Sensor sees light when

980
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,792
You not know about a parallella board

981
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,864
Sounds like a VR

982
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
Perambulation device

983
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,960
Ambulation

984
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,776
I don't know what a parallella board is

985
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:37,408
But if it's anything even close to an esp32 I'm not interested

986
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:42,784
Because I haven't esp32

987
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:56,096
It's an fpga development board as cost money

988
01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:02,496
I'm not dealing with it know if I can do it while on a on a $2 microcontroller I'm doing on a $2 microcontroller

989
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:10,688
I'm not spending anymore unless you have a magical source for refugees that can do this there's like two bucks.

990
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,456
Touching it

991
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:22,464
I think you better just get back to it it'll never finished

992
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:28,864
You're OU I need I need to just do this you guys can just talk While I Work It says you guys are pretty familiar with it now

993
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,544
Which one did I steevens Simplicity but why aren't you using something more

994
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Advanced

995
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,408
I don't know what is get it

996
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
Sounds familiar

997
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,272
This is

998
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:52,416
It's small and small and lightweight

999
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,632
Do I need to go figure out how to actually put the state at into the right place

1000
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,192
So

1001
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:08,544
CTX Arrow

1002
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,592
I think Mel has got it now

1003
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:20,832
And so the golfer today is to figure out the math necessary to figure out where those reference point

1004
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:27,232
Points are once we know where the lighthouses are we can then Trace back to figure out where

1005
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,280
The headset and the

1006
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
Handheld controllers are

1007
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,728
Assume for right now everything's got 32 locations

1008
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,360
So what exactly do we mean by finding the lighthouses

1009
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,712
So right now we just know basically times that light hits things

1010
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:51,552
Andweknow theoretically the time of the sweeps

1011
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,696
And so you should be able to with math basically figure out

1012
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,768
I guess it's a whole trigonometry problem basic

1013
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,560
That we basically can use

1014
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,584
X

1015
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,984
Light impacting Those sensors to figure out where in some kind of 3D space

1016
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,032
White houses are

1017
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,080
Does that make sense

1018
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:20,736
What I'm saying but doesn't make sense

1019
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:25,856
See each other I know they're there I don't know

1020
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:32,256
I don't think that they actually know where they are

1021
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:38,656
Anything or do they just talk back in Forth

1022
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:45,056
Other so that they're not both interfering with each other and I believe that there's also a signal that spelling disc

1023
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,360
Timing of what no

1024
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
There's not actually the long flash as far as I can tell is what tells this thing all the time in

1025
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:59,392
So you could theoretically if you knew exactly the location of the two lighthouses

1026
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,440
And where they're pointed and everything

1027
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:07,840
You would even be able to tell where you are in the room without any communication to the rest of the vibe at all I think

1028
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:15,520
I think someone else had said in chat before that specifically the lighthouses do not communicate with the

1029
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,544
Dcn anyway

1030
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,408
So only the controllers my headset communicate to PC

1031
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,480
Do the controller's communicate with the headset and then the headset

1032
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:30,624
Everything together and then send that to the BC so there's only one USB cable for this whole thing

1033
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,416
Whereas the

1034
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:37,280
The rift right now heads up to 3 if you got the

1035
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:42,400
And then one of them is power

1036
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:49,056
One of them is video one of them is data and audio is going to come through that date as well and then they

1037
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:55,456
There's actually an audio device in there it's generates an audio signal which comes out this one's you can plug in your headphones

1038
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:58,016
They used to have a cable that was this big

1039
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:04,416
All The Way We Were among the first people to get one of those and we didn't even know that

1040
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,464
Really lucky

1041
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,280
Apparently that was the day we bought this

1042
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,888
The day they switched over to water the controller send data to the headset

1043
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:20,288
Wireless that is wireless wireless mouse apparently they use wireless mouse to type trans

1044
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,848
Receivers for that sort of thing

1045
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:31,552
Come in now

1046
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:47,680
So have we tried changing the Arts or having collected data that we've liked had the

1047
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:54,080
Lighthouses at 1 high the moon like a different I don't think we need it because we know

1048
01:30:54,336 --> 01:31:00,480
So much about the details with the spinning so I think simply have

1049
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:06,880
Having one of these devices sitting in the middle of the floor whatever should be enough to do everything we need

1050
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:13,280
Because it wanted sweeps it'll be hitting multiple fractures so from here

1051
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:19,680
Raise theoretically from the center of that thing out into the scene and hit just like

1052
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:26,080
Reverse it I guess and then based on that be able to try to move I'm going to try to move that thing right

1053
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:32,480
Around in order to try and find an orientation in a position which would match like the theoretical position

1054
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:38,880
Abby's dots from where it is trying to move it around until I can find some

1055
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:44,000
Orientation and everything where the data I'm getting for when those lights got hit

1056
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,280
Matches

1057
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:49,376
Where I went at the data that I think it should be heading to hit all those

1058
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
So like

1059
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:56,800
If this headset was the lighthouses in it

1060
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,592
Just needs to know like

1061
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:04,992
If it knows that the lighthouses are spitting it at The Tickler frequency then maybe it only needs to know

1062
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:12,672
The difference between like with the timing of Wendy's since it's facing

1063
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:17,792
This way this is really going to get hit like he's undercover here going to get hit like

1064
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,072
Bam

1065
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:25,472
Bambam and so it but if you turn it this way then they're going to get hit

1066
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,288
Rite fans

1067
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,616
So from lighthouses point of view

1068
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:37,504
It would mean that if it was oriented this way and it was coming through is going to Bam Bam Bam real quick

1069
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:43,904
It would mean that the lighthouse would have to be at this position relative to the headset

1070
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
We just need to know that the lighthouses are in a consistent time and the only thing that matters are the difference in the

1071
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,120
Temporal difference in Wendy's receive signal

1072
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,080
That's why doesn't matter what he put those cuz the only thing that matters because this this height

1073
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:08,480
The orientation this way because it's not just me

1074
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,904
Always in One Direction

1075
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,488
Right and so if it was aim down more

1076
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,144
Then that would mean it would appear that it was towards the top of the frame physically lower it would also appear

1077
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:32,544
Another question if it's rotating is it going family member here and then bam bam bam down over on the other side

1078
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,944
Do inside the lighthouses the speed B when they spend they go away

1079
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Decide

1080
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:46,112
So like the one that goes in the up-and-down traction you're saying it only goes it's only Circle

1081
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:50,464
Killer and when it's pointing in the back of it I guess either have the laser off or it's just not doing

1082
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:54,304
Are you sure it's a rotating emotion and not just a sweeping motion

1083
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:57,376
Align

1084
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,776
I don't understand

1085
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:10,688
You could have a light you have a line of light that is going in a circle and it's rotating in

1086
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:17,088
From the lighthouses point of

1087
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:20,672
View the lighthouses right here it'll go

1088
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,208
Like this

1089
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:29,120
So the whole plain of like that's sweeping the whole thing right

1090
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,144
Sweet

1091
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:36,544
It is it is rotating around the lighthouse like that but from our point of view it.

1092
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:42,432
Doesn't light up when it's going on the back so

1093
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:48,832
It's not going to the plane of projection

1094
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,112
Projection not

1095
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,416
Parallel to its plane of projection

1096
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:56,000
Yovino not parallel no is coming out from the from basically the center

1097
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,816
Quote

1098
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Float

1099
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,864
Actually looks

1100
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,472
On my PC since doubles are not slow for me I will use a double

1101
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:09,568
Survive internal dates line 7900

1102
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:20,576
Are you guys watching chat for me so I can keep working

1103
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:24,160
I don't know I think that by explaining it to you they understood it better and that's

1104
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,464
Exactly half of this battle

1105
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,560
Do we know if the the lighthouses have a

1106
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,400
Actual rotating laser or is it a laser when a rotating mirror

1107
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,728
We're not entirely sure it doesn't really matter okay

1108
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:43,104
I'm sure that there are many people

1109
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,384
Who do know that

1110
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,920
I do not

1111
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,904
Oh you've added something to the issue

1112
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
Have you

1113
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
I will pull it up

1114
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
Commodes

1115
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,432
Oh hello

1116
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,736
That's kind of neat

1117
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,552
This is he says he took the config data

1118
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:29,952
And he figured out what position all the things were in yet

1119
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:36,864
Bullet funny with the three at the end

1120
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,448
Peter on the light again

1121
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,056
Yeah that totally

1122
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,920
Where the one in the middle

1123
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,712
Are there any of the middle

1124
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:58,880
There is a camera on the front of the headset but that does not look like a sensor

1125
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,928
So yeah the hell yeah

1126
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,512
Yeah and this is oriented in the right organ is orientation

1127
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:12,960
Was just asking about that actually I don't actually know this but we

1128
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:19,360
I believe that the camera is only really used for the The Chaperone system right now which was

1129
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:25,760
Did the camera showed up just before they release this thing it hadn't been in any of the prototypes or anything like that and the

1130
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,320
The idea of the camera was that it would

1131
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:34,976
When you get near the boundary of your playable area it would show you a little bit of the cameras fee

1132
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:41,120
Process to look like a cool blue outline we can talk a little bit

1133
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:45,472
Buggy apparently and it slowed things down and some people aren't using it

1134
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:52,384
Are you seriously

1135
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,760
From the from the the camera on the HTC Vive

1136
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:05,952
Let us know if that does bad things to our stream by the way cuz we have a very very limited data Ray

1137
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,304
How do you tell if a nice things don't go together

1138
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:15,424
Okay I'm going to keep coding right now cuz we got to get this data pars okay

1139
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,016
Diane save I saved

1140
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:34,624
BK Tuesday says the normals that he had in his thing look weird

1141
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,928
And we turned it off didn't we

1142
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:41,280
But yes it's not the camera

1143
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,328
Sorry it's right there

1144
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,888
Cameras back on

1145
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,960
It doesn't cast to the screen here

1146
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:54,592
No actually you know what I can make it cast the screen but then nobody else can see it

1147
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,664
Well I'm blind

1148
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,480
I don't think I can

1149
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:06,880
Charles has the Vive plugged into his laptop right now and that's how he's getting all kinds of data from it and he was just able to

1150
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:13,280
Connect right to the camera stream do you want me to I can totally weird you out Monday I can open up my laptops

1151
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,560
Hold on

1152
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:29,920
Windy out here for that I'm going to

1153
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:32,736
Jack in and put this picture right here

1154
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:39,136
On her

1155
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:45,536
Charles's face

1156
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:55,008
Okay moving on okay

1157
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,544
Text us to compile bugs

1158
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,824
I'm going to kill it now

1159
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:09,600
Oh but this is stuck at the video from a 5 is coming through a BNC connector

1160
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:16,000
Change my computer desktop computer from a laptop and then it's going out

1161
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,816
To YouTube through my cell phone so it's

1162
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,888
Has an excuse for being blurry

1163
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:29,568
Yes4all if you were asking if Charles has a degree he does and

1164
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:36,224
I have a I have a regular four-year degree which took me five years because I am a

1165
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:41,600
As they call him the math dolt cuz I was not in college because I failed calculus

1166
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:44,416
1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3

1167
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:50,560
But I did get a master's degree in computer science little while later and I did okay by then my I got that

1168
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:54,144
Sort of not nearly as well as my brother I don't know if you still watching

1169
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:58,496
My my brother got the the math genes in my family

1170
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,080
Why is it wrong

1171
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
Sodium nice

1172
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Is that right

1173
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,296
85

1174
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:18,976
Pay 96 National encouragement for all of you people who think you're terrible at math

1175
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,536
Computers

1176
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
It's okay

1177
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,864
Nigra have to work at it

1178
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,472
I didn't give up and I work my butt off even though I knew I was failing with a with an F

1179
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:33,056
I I've worked my butt off but I was able to get it eventually

1180
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:45,088
So you guys were saying something earlier about not not sure if something was like 9990 r180

1181
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:50,976
The synchronization of the sweeps of lasers

1182
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:59,168
I don't know whether Charles was talking about between the two different things or just

1183
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,984
90 degrees out of phase so if this one goes sweep

1184
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:08,384
Like if they like this one goes sweet

1185
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:14,784
One has it's 90 degrees out of phase and those are 180 degrees out of phase I miss one so it's pretty

1186
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:19,392
Strong though or think they're all one

1187
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:25,792
Think they're I think it just turns them off when it's not using up the I think

1188
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:32,192
Cuz you don't want these to be getting light at the same time from two different ones

1189
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,728
Canadian FaZe

1190
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,032
As in like sweep

1191
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:42,688
And then the next one is it comes around sweep and the next Wednesday comes around sweep and actually comes around sweep

1192
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:47,552
They might I don't know

1193
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,344
Light from both of them

1194
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:55,488
Cuz if you face it this way then this is only going to be on their Frontier

1195
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,096
And this one's only going to be getting information from here like how would this weekend information from that one

1196
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,632
I'm sorry say it again

1197
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,192
Sorry

1198
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:11,616
Oh Jupiter is talking about his own Vive being blurry and yeah that's definitely

1199
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:18,016
Distance between the eyes is a little dial there what I would do hold the Vive in cannae

1200
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:21,856
And I want to get to alexys

1201
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:28,256
Question or something there but so when try to get your Vive 2

1202
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:34,912
Not be blurry like that you want to make sure you adjust it up and down properly just shifted up and down on your face

1203
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:39,008
Until it looks best and then try to fix all your straps there

1204
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,288
Strap here

1205
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,568
And besides wraps

1206
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,896
Then you want to try shifting side to side

1207
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:51,296
And how I describe the see there's a dial here on the side which will adjust the lenses in and out and it can't

1208
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:54,880
Take you awhile to get that right so what I was doing was

1209
01:43:55,136 --> 01:44:01,280
I was looking at my right eye only and seeing if I needed to shift it this way or this way I knew that if I

1210
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,328
I needed to shift it this way

1211
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,144
That what

1212
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:13,312
That I needed the lens to come in and so then I would dial into the lenses would come together and I would check the same thing with the other eye

1213
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:18,944
Basically should be pretty clear really

1214
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:25,600
Bother texting me little coating trick I thought I'd show you guys a one of the annoying things about csvs

1215
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:32,000
Just like you have to put like commas between the elements than a new line at the end and it can get really yucky but

1216
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:38,400
A friend showed me a while ago is this little trick right here what you can do is you can say printf you can print out the now

1217
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:41,984
Number and then percent Siemens print out a character

1218
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:48,384
And so I can print out F and then I can if it's the last element print out a new line or if

1219
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:52,736
If it's earlier on I can print out a, like that

1220
01:44:55,296 --> 01:45:01,440
No right here I wouldn't have one day CSV

1221
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,976
Kind of works

1222
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,304
Correction or something

1223
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:11,680
I should probably copy that into a CSV Allen has more words for you

1224
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:16,032
Charles start with One Sensor One lighthouse in moday

1225
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,336
Until you understand the sync system

1226
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:22,688
I'm sensor1 Lighthouse movie

1227
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:29,088
I don't understand the differences in the modes but that's what it says to go in when you only have a single lighthouse

1228
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,560
There's a mode where you have a single lighthouse

1229
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
I don't I don't understand that I haven't tried it yet cuz we know I guess you could do it with one lighthouse

1230
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:47,264
That's really hard to do but

1231
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:50,080
What is your gift to lighthouses

1232
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:52,640
He's figuring out how close or far

1233
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,688
The thing is you have to see

1234
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:58,784
How big or small this thing appears in the blight houses

1235
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:02,624
Field of view I'll let me go upload the CSV right now though

1236
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:09,792
Where did I.

1237
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,840
I guess

1238
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:17,984
Moday means it doesn't take turns

1239
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:23,104
If you don't have this one and then that one

1240
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,920
Boulder

1241
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,248
Why why would I want

1242
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,344
I mean when I analyze it it's going to be less but

1243
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,880
I can just

1244
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:40,768
Throw out the packet that are coming in from sync Pulses from the other one

1245
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,560
Seems less

1246
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,608
I don't know

1247
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:51,520
Michael says if if you mapped the perlite house per device Spencer strike events in

1248
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:57,920
An image using the sweep relative event time step is the relative position of the pixel

1249
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:05,344
My 8.1.5 equals dead center

1250
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:11,744
The resulting image is equivalent to what a constellation style tracking camera would normally generator

1251
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,144
You can feed this into a conventional PNP algorithm using contemporaneous images from each lighthouses

1252
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,192
Thanks for an optimized pose

1253
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:26,592
Okay you said a lot of things that are more complicated than those boring see programmers mine is going to deal with

1254
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,896
Michael's messages

1255
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,624
Okay

1256
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,000
So right now we have that

1257
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:47,328
One thing at a time

1258
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,984
Help Benz joined us

1259
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,800
My bad

1260
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:07,040
He says the but Michael was saying as how the original tracking system work

1261
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:16,768
I'll let you know I'm not getting seeing pinga pinga things I'm getting it cuz I want to steal the GUI

1262
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,888
By the way if you guys haven't already seen see anything it's the coolest thing ever

1263
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,448
Try to advertise this to everybody

1264
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,776
It's free it's on GitHub and

1265
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,848
Google Google

1266
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:36,992
And oh well I guess that's really bad

1267
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,208
Alan says that is a bad approximation but a good starting point I don't know who sing that too

1268
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,256
Our life in pain isn't working

1269
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:51,584
Oh well don't care I just wanted to get it to get the

1270
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,888
What is it called here

1271
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:57,216
OS generic

1272
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:02,336
And I want to get my hands on her all functions

1273
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,920
When Noah uses seeing ping

1274
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,712
Does he

1275
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:14,112
Oh hey I know thank you for using CN paying don't forget to develop it further now we just need people to be you

1276
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:14,880
Using

1277
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,672
Color cord

1278
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:21,536
Yeah color Corey I got to do that video explaining how color cord works that's going to be

1279
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,584
Salon in the tooth

1280
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,120
What is an idiom mean

1281
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:31,776
That's a very good question what does long in the tooth mean

1282
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:34,848
Watching can you tell us what long in the tooth means

1283
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,040
Okay

1284
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,600
I'm going to do now

1285
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:48,928
I'm going to in

1286
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,256
Yahtzee

1287
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:55,328
I'm going to go open

1288
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:59,168
Window

1289
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,800
Michaels

1290
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:40,640
Written down all of the stuff that he told us in the

1291
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:47,296
In the vibe subreddit so we'll have that for a record for later if you can please

1292
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:53,696
I'd like these big notes and stuff to the issue on GitHub that makes it easier for me to track later

1293
01:50:53,952 --> 01:51:00,096
Cuz everything will be inside the live survive GitHub to remember I think we're going to turn live survive until way more than

1294
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:05,472
Library that can do this but like a Tome of Justice Collective fun of

1295
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:11,872
5 Adventure having album says you need to zip the CSV because GitHub will not

1296
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:14,944
Except seattle.vs which is really weird that is weird

1297
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,368
We should have used ssds

1298
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
Too late now

1299
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:47,456
Chaos if you can open the hmd file now or the points file

1300
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,040
I don't know

1301
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:54,880
The RPMs of sensory rather the light sweeps in the

1302
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,160
Monogamous

1303
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:00,768
Transportation I think it has to be 120

1304
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:06,656
By the way

1305
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,216
Howdy

1306
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:14,080
I would really like it was 15

1307
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:19,968
It would be it would have to be 120 cuz if it goes 0

1308
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:25,344
And if this is 200,000 ticks and that's 400,000 takes and then back to zero

1309
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:32,000
You divide 360

1310
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,792
Rotate on their perspective boxes

1311
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:36,352
60 revolutions

1312
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:43,008
Eventually it gets to the point it says any check object decided tracking volume is hit by a laser at a rate of

1313
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,288
120 hertz

1314
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:47,616
So what you sexy

1315
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,784
Okay so

1316
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,880
60 I'm guessing is what that

1317
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,184
Figured out he says yes 60

1318
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,744
Is it really

1319
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:10,400
That's what we get from Doc okay Lighthouse tracking examination 100,000

1320
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:14,752
Okay then why in the world is Center to 200,000 ticks

1321
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:19,616
Or am I just supposed

1322
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,712
200 + 200 + 200

1323
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,480
200

1324
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,016
Maybe

1325
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,576
Oh

1326
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,880
Yeah okay that's possible

1327
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:36,256
I have to keep going I have to keep going here

1328
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,304
Before I get too tired

1329
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:44,448
10:30

1330
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:47,520
Your coffee no ice cream

1331
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:53,408
Actually we do want ice cream for ice cream

1332
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,968
No

1333
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,808
That

1334
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:06,976
Maybe someday

1335
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:21,312
Yes Jupiter we were actually pointing out the insides of the lighthouses earlier we understand

1336
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:25,920
Physically what's going on in there you just don't know everything about the timing in the

1337
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,480
Spin rate and everything

1338
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:31,040
Who's asked me if we looked inside the lighthouses

1339
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:36,672
I don't know where the beam is plenty of time to think flash I don't have a high speed camera

1340
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:41,280
The only thing I was looking at was its 200,000 Cycles roughly between

1341
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:47,680
The sink Flash and when I get hit by the beam I was assuming it was cuz the beam was like roll to the back of the camera during that

1342
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,448
What time

1343
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:53,568
Oz where is the being pointing at the time so that the

1344
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,128
While one

1345
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:59,200
Steve

1346
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:17,888
Yeah YouTube won't let you post links

1347
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,496
If you want to post anything Post in the issue

1348
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:26,592
Can you like post a sanitized link like

1349
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:33,248
Change the.com to a natcom or something I tried that it didn't work

1350
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,784
They're onto you

1351
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,808
Goal

1352
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:46,560
She had a Spam problem so I wish we could just allow it understand

1353
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:51,680
I understand problem the first like life thing I did I have it such a fan problem

1354
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,448
Okay

1355
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:02,944
Leaving my mouse on tablet go back to see if link health is good

1356
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,712
Wondering

1357
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,016
Okay

1358
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:17,792
You need to find some kind of coordinate system for the base station X

1359
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:24,960
That's what I found for the lighthouse and just pulled out the. In. Org

1360
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,136
That wrong

1361
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:21,280
I can do that wrong I wrote this Library I still got my things wrong

1362
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,400
Portents of the future

1363
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:40,736
Yeah I had tried that before Albin just leaving out the ww.w and everything before it but it still complained until

1364
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,784
Kelly took out the. And.com

1365
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,600
P.com

1366
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,136
Remember

1367
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,976
Homestar Runner

1368
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:55,328
A very long time

1369
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:03,264
Jupiter asked which games you recommend a very interesting one just popped out called super Kaiju its kind

1370
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,032
Kind of like

1371
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,568
The

1372
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:09,152
Space pirate trainer Regis shooting at targets in front of you pretty much

1373
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,176
But

1374
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,712
You

1375
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:18,112
You have to play against another person who's doing it at the same time and so you each try to shoot these targets to get more points

1376
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:24,512
And what's the point you spend them on these cards that you draw him a debt to attack the other player

1377
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:30,144
It's hard to describe and there are not a lot of people in multiplayer yet so get it

1378
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:33,216
I need more people to crush

1379
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:58,816
You don't want one sister to receive light from both

1380
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:01,120
Lighthouses plug that one

1381
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:07,520
Right don't worry about it

1382
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:13,920
Came in and both hit one at the same time it would be like around a while

1383
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:20,320
Exactly

1384
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,344
Effacing

1385
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,904
Start way

1386
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,928
That way

1387
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:27,232
Lansing

1388
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:33,632
This one is only if you were back in that corner if you were back in that corner and they happens to sweep and hit it

1389
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,936
Same time that would be

1390
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:41,568
And so it is possible to get yourself in some kind of geometry that that would happen and so they just

1391
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:46,432
There's no reason they couldn't so they just sent them to be timed so that won't ever happen

1392
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,248
Sweet sweet

1393
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:09,472
Yes Jupiter I do challenge you to a duel

1394
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:17,920
Put it on and look at Charles's face again

1395
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:26,112
Yes I actually have one of the

1396
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:33,024
I have the original Oculus that I got from the kickstarter and then I got the Oculus that they just gave

1397
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:39,424
Gateway for free which I was very impressed that they did that and it's good it's so much better than all the earlier ones but then the vibe came out

1398
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:46,848
Goodness it's definitely a lot better but I haven't actually sat them down side-by-side and compared them

1399
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,896
I do need to do that

1400
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:52,992
I do think it looks better just off the top of my head in here but it

1401
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:59,648
I I don't really remember the one thing I do notice right off the bat as you don't have nearly as big of a problem with the god raised with this

1402
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:01,184
Where is the Oculus

1403
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:07,840
Whenever you had a dark area with a really bright source of light you get this weird Ray cast

1404
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:13,984
As if they didn't put a Nancy reflective coating inside the inside the thing I don't entirely know what that is

1405
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:19,872
I don't know whether they fix that later on I lived on a lot of things since so hopefully

1406
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:22,944
But that was one of the big problems I think the Oculus

1407
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:24,992
Had

1408
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:27,808
What wavelength this working out

1409
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:32,672
What wavelength of light

1410
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:37,792
It's at least around 8:50 I think 850

1411
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:40,352
Nanometers

1412
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:47,264
Although you know what everything I said technically about the HTC Vive is going wrong and Alan his correct

1413
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,616
Are we on a first-name basis

1414
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:57,504
Like all you can do is be like here.

1415
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:02,368
I like Santa that you can never see my face

1416
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,464
That would like a high-speed IR camera

1417
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:15,168
Ashley Charles did you ever post that are video I never did post the other video

1418
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:21,568
A camera that he took the internal IR filter out of and then you put an external everything but I are filled

1419
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:27,200
So only IR gets through and he pointed it at the lighthouses and it looked pretty neat

1420
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:32,064
Gives you good luck in the inside them

1421
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,344
850

1422
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:40,000
And 835

1423
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:43,584
One of his one of them the LEDs and one of them's the lasers

1424
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:49,984
Are the two different

1425
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:56,384
No no no

1426
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,688
Different times

1427
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:04,320
Well I took photodiode I looked at all the county Dory I think

1428
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:09,184
Wait till they have to be the same frequency cuz we only get

1429
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:14,816
The time data from that

1430
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:21,216
Something like when I get data from there it doesn't differentiate like this came in at this time

1431
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:23,520
Lasers 835 LEDs 850

1432
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:30,176
So it's just a matter of like the technical the lasers you use happen to be 8:30 okay

1433
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,968
Presumably

1434
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,296
Watch even that be wrong

1435
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:46,816
Yeah I'm looking forward to that microhex we're trying to find a good way to support the cable in our house

1436
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:53,216
And it's not right now just leaving it on the floor is really pissed anything up in the air keeps getting hot

1437
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,752
Toddler hands when doing stuff

1438
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:10,624
LEDs are going to have a wider Spectrum or lasers or narrower doubt there's a difference in functionality and detection

1439
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:17,280
That would if there were a few guys use two different wavelengths that would have totally wrecked up

1440
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:21,632
A whole bunch of my plans so I'm really glad that that's not the case

1441
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,752
I will happily Google that one

1442
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:28,288
Ben Jackson

1443
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:39,552
Oh my gosh I have never had a problem with cnfcu why is this not working

1444
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:45,952
I was thinking of

1445
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:52,352
Getting like a Unistrut with the little track followers in it and then kind of hinging it to the Eunice Trotwood

1446
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:58,752
Hang around you have a couple track things with the cable like festoon to cross their that's a little bit over-the-top

1447
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:02,336
If I'm actually going to go quite that far

1448
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:10,272
If we ever get our company a better office then we'll probably just set up a permanent thing and there was like a Gantry track roller

1449
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:17,184
The difficulty with that is going to be the inertia I don't want it yanking off the

1450
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,208
Vyve

1451
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:28,960
Okay if you guys see whatever I'm doing wrong I'd really appreciate it cuz like right now I'm crashing on

1452
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:34,080
Printing out!!

1453
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:39,712
Alan says early basis were 6:50 and 8:50

1454
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:41,760
Nanometers

1455
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:44,064
Okay is anybody in this

1456
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:48,928
Would you mind going back in like copying and pasting these really key things to text file

1457
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:56,352
Like a notepad like anything like when he was saying the early bases were 650 and like that's really

1458
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:59,936
Cool like this cool information like the lasers or 850

1459
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:06,336
Bread bread

1460
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:12,736
I wouldn't write it down on their copy paste into Notepad

1461
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:14,272
Okay

1462
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:19,392
Wait but why why does weighted telling me why it's broken

1463
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:24,000
Says main task survive in it now lock

1464
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:32,448
Survive and yet survive c76 invalid write of size 8

1465
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:34,496
Survive. C line 103

1466
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:42,944
So another really cool to Liz valgrind if you ever write stuff in Sea and you're running into problems

1467
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:48,576
We're like my things crashing I don't know why valgrind will tell you absolutely gorgeous Lee

1468
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:53,440
By the way Charles you tried writing a text somewhere you shouldn't have

1469
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:59,072
And it tells me it was on this line of this file which is really crazy

1470
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:05,472
I'm so glad that the Dahlgren does what it does it actually blew my mind for a number of years

1471
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:09,056
But it turns out valgrind is an x86 emulator

1472
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:11,104
That runs on your computer

1473
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:17,504
But whatever you call system calls it calls it to your host system so it's an x86 emulator running

1474
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,320
Hang on your computer in a virtual environment

1475
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:26,720
On the host system so it's simulating a computer to tell me what I write somewhere I'm not

1476
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,744
How to write

1477
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,816
Really cool

1478
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:35,168
Surviving it line 103

1479
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,496
Lost connection

1480
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,544
And reconnecting

1481
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:46,944
Piano 850s internet connection successful

1482
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:50,528
Make sure you start copying the stuff out I am working on it okay

1483
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:54,880
Do I have an unlimited data plan and I have screamed

1484
02:07:55,136 --> 02:08:00,256
Tens of gigabytes friend's cabin before but you never know where it it when it's going to change

1485
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:06,144
Whistleblowers silenced

1486
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,240
Play the Falcon whistleblower

1487
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,288
What wires what is he joking about

1488
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,056
I don't know

1489
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,360
Thousand took him out

1490
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:22,528
Do you actually know the guy who made valgrind cuz I don't that would be super cool

1491
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:29,184
Writing 95 + 95 is when it Dido it's cuz I got to

1492
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:36,608
An allocation it's cuz this should be at the end of the flu

1493
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:40,448
Generate under gets into a ride

1494
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,240
It's not visible red

1495
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:45,056
Finest kind of Isabel

1496
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:46,592
Wait a minute

1497
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:51,456
Oh you know what did the bass turn off when I turned off the other one

1498
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:58,112
Cuz you haven't said it into moday how do you set things into moday I haven't actually I'll bet you there's some head string I can

1499
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:02,464
Can send it that somebody's figure it out but I don't feel like dealing with that right now

1500
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,144
Died right he said something about valgrind

1501
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,680
Ice cream

1502
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,704
What

1503
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:18,080
Know that we did actually lose connection to the stream that's why I dropped

1504
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:24,480
Okay I was just saying the valgrind is awesome because it's an x86 emulator that runs on your computer to pretending to

1505
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:27,040
Be your computer running code

1506
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,320
With

1507
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:34,464
Connected to your like your actual computers Colonel and it all just does its thing and it tells you where your bugs are

1508
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:43,680
Okay so looks like that bug went away nobody looks in the manual Jupiter

1509
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:49,312
Do you actually have the manual

1510
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:54,432
Fortunately we have valve people here to tell us what to do

1511
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,968
Thank you Val people

1512
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:04,160
Does it say on it

1513
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,512
Not yet emitting infrared

1514
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:10,304
Oara

1515
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,072
8

1516
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:15,168
Maybe sesay and we just can't read be

1517
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:18,496
Oh that would have been an ass

1518
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:23,872
I think it's an uppercase a

1519
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:26,176
And then a large lowercase b

1520
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:48,960
Chop more wood while it's light out there is there's a fair bit of wood that's chopped over on the woodpile

1521
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:52,800
I see it

1522
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:59,200
Hahira

1523
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:04,320
Is a challenge anything about it cuz I took it off a while longer

1524
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:10,720
I was going to challenge them to get Half-Life 3 out before I get the the vibe reversing

1525
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:17,120
Okay I guess I'll just say it I was thinking about challenging the the valve people to get high

1526
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:23,520
Half-Life 3 out before I get a fully functional HTC Vive

1527
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:26,080
The environment working

1528
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,104
Adam

02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:30,432

Colorful

1532
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:43,744
Did you put a sparkler there a 1987 sparkler in there

1533
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,584
They are 1987 sparklers

1534
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:54,240
Wow

1535
02:11:54,752 --> 02:12:00,896
Holland you want to move to take the bike over there we'll watch it

1536
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:12,416
Get a closer I just went out sorry guys you missed the sparkler that Adam through into the fireplace

1537
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:19,072
It was very exciting you really miss.

1538
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:23,168
I'm closing it now

1539
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:29,824
I can help us provide that I'm going to close it

1540
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,848
Okay

1541
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:32,896

Can you can get ice cream now

1544
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:53,632
Maybe I kind of do but then it's going to melt produced like water

1545
02:12:53,888 --> 02:13:00,032
You should eat ice cream now before it gets later

1546
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:06,176
Refrigerator

1547
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:10,016
Yeah your ice cream now

1548
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:14,880
All the water died

1549
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:23,840
Okay Adams going to try to get the water at the cabin working again

1550
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:30,752

02:13:57,376 --> 02:14:01,472
Turn off the water heater first

1559
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:08,128
I'm sorry people in chat there's nobody reading chat right now

1560

1566
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,592

Oh

1577
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:37,728
Can somebody check to make sure the faucet out there didn't get turned on turn on the lights and then go there on

1578
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:40,032
Make sure that the faucet in the front didn't get turned on

1579
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,896
That the faucet mini knows where it is

1580
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:47,712
Right

1581
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:54,112
Oh that's not good

1582
02:15:56,416 --> 02:16:02,560
I need

1583
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:08,960
Your place out in the sticks while there's a lot of there's a lot of sticks

1584
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:11,008
Reflectix you mean trees

1585
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:23,552
Is all the are all the faucets off okay can somebody walk out around the

1586
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:27,648
The left side of the cabin and just make sure there's not water shooting out from somewhere

1587
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:32,000
Like the side of the cabin like on that side

1588
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:38,656
Like outside walk around the cabin and look for water coming out somewhere

1589
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:41,728
Hear water moving

1590
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:43,776
Is it like

1591
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,872
That's just concerning

1592
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:01,696
If Adam here's the back there I don't think that's what we're hearing

1593
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,656
Yeah the toilet running

1594
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:15,776
Oh okay toilet

1595
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:22,432
Oh okay

1596
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:28,832
This morning what happened was the fa

1597
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:33,440
Outside Pro Shot even though it was open so during the night it slowly like

1598
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:40,096
It is melted until when I woke up this morning I heard the hot water heater like the element

1599
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:44,960
And I had to let quickly turn everything off so

1600
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:51,360
Okay can you get back to the duty where you do the thing with the chat

1601
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:57,248
I do the thing is done

1602
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:07,488
Charles does want to do a Vive VR programming interface

1603
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:14,656
So you can register programming environment SEC tinycc is the coolest thing ever

1604
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:21,056
Mermaid because you can like write programs and you can save it and you can recompile the program

1605
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:27,456
I'd like use all of the same date it was running with and keep executing with new code in one frame

1606
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:33,600
You can just like Eddie code on the Fly and it just keeps running and can I get a spoon

1607
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:40,000
Please

1608
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:43,840
Wilderness preserve the water through the night that means no showers but

1609
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,144
Already got mine

1610
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:53,312
Stinky rub myself all over your bed

1611
02:18:56,640 --> 02:19:02,784
Paul says he looked into that but couldn't find any documentation for how to do that with feces

1612
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:11,488
I have an example of me doing it in no Euclid if you just if you just Google no Euclid

1613
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:17,888
Indian lore I have a video where I demonstrated and the code is available in GitHub for that

1614
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:24,032
Separated out to its own module so you can copy and paste the Tsetse tools out of that into any project

1615
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:36,832
I would love to meet Pascal there sorry for Bruce Ballard before I die

1616
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:39,648
That guy has written so much cool stuff

1617
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:48,608
X-rayed and like you can use a toilet but don't use it very much

1618
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:54,752
There's an outhouse outside that's unlimited use that is unlimited use the Outhouse is unlimited use

1619
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:57,568
Basilic crazy things in it

1620
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:59,360
Mom got rid of all them

1621
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:04,480
Year-and-a-half two years

1622
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:09,600
But it's like Outdoors you can kind of just princess pees everywhere anywhere

1623
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:12,672
You can just it's the woods nobody cares

02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:20,096
Places to ski in the morning

1625
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:30,592
All right so what I'm doing cuz I'm exposing to buffers I'm going to be using them in survive process

1626
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:34,176
So I can in real-time visualize some of this data

1627
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:56,448
I guess we wouldn't be allowed to like pee off the porch.

1628
02:20:57,984 --> 02:20:59,520
No peeing off the porch

1629
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:04,896
We should do a livestream of drive all the way up all the way

1630
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:06,432
The house

1631
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:09,248
The final space okay

1632
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,528
Will do that

1633
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:13,088
Do that next time

1634
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,160
Figure out how to do it though

1635
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:19,488
Well just serve wifi with my phone and don't have to

1636
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:26,656
No no

1637
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:39,456
Read more down for the GoPro

1638
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:47,648
See this is how you do it

1639
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:53,024
Double the sugar

1640
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:58,400
The Jackson wants us to call something jnk

1641
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:07,360
I believe I have that

1642
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:15,296
Charles are you using the IMU for data track data for tracking will I will be using

1643
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:21,696
Emu hopefully but hopefully David Chapman is going to be helping me out a lot there I'm just talk about Jay

1644
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:28,096
B&K stinks okay. And it's this table right here is what they're taught

1645
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:28,864
Talking about

1646
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,400
But I'm not there yet

1647
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:37,824
Need a second monitor why do I care about Jane Casey

1648
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,896
Euro 10 J&K yabi

1649
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:47,296
JK JK

1650
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:50,112
In my other desktop

1651
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,000
Yeah

1652
02:22:56,256 --> 02:23:02,400
Because they're not because I have a laptop

1653
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:12,640
And resources

1654
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:15,712
Don't worry about it stop thinking about it just go

1655
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,744
Are you seriously using that as a spoon

1656
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,144
Nope

1657
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:41,312
Oh man what is up with the J&K thing nevermind it's not

1658
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:47,712
But I thought it was why is that

1659
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:52,064
Okay this this logic is probably wrong but you can just

1660
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:58,464
You don't have to yell at me right now I'm unconfident to state is wrong you guys

1661
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,256
Hopping hoping someone working

1662
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:22,272
Everything is a spoon if you're brave enough hay

1663
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:26,368
Or not

1664
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:28,672
Or something what what's going on

1665
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:33,536
Oh you know what this is clearly oud move us around

1666
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:44,288
Can you make the other window visible so sorry

1667
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:55,040
And you can see what you're holding at in the screen

1668
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:59,904
A little lower

1669
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:04,768
Okay so it's kind of I clearly have that wrong though

1670
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:08,096
Let's try zero and one

1671
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:10,656
2 and 3 Maybe

1672
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:15,008
Oh that's super wrong

1673
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:18,848
That is super wrong

1674
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,640
Where we looking to right now

1675
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:26,528
Trying to look at a readout of the positions being trapped

1676
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:32,928
And infirmary have any do this again so what I have is a library call draw draw

1677
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:37,024
Which allows you to take like any c program or C Ghostbuster anyting

1678
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:43,424
And windows Linux whatever I want to open a window and I want to draw some points want to draw syntax

1679
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:49,824
I wrote it many years ago for I don't know if when I was in college

1680
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:56,224
Quadro is actually distributed inside of the endings you can just use raw draw and with

1681
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,504
Really simple stop just

1682
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:02,880
You say seanachie setup you give me the window name and window size

1683
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:05,696
And then you can call handle input

1684
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:09,536
Clear frame set the color get dimensions

1685
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:13,888
Straw bunch of pixels drossin text swap buffers weight

1686
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:20,288
And it just keeps doing it over and over and over and over

1687
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,848
If you know what I will do that right now

1688
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:25,664
So instead of dots I can do

1689
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:43,840
Tutak rectangle

1690
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:04,064
Can you make a chart its own color so that we can keep track of what. Is where

1691
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,624
That's a good idea I will do that

1692
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,672
Can you move around so make sure this works

1693
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:16,352
Still not tracking you why is it out here

1694
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:25,312
You know what I think because the top of the screen is 0 instead of the bottom of the screen it's

1695
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:30,432
Hold on here

1696
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:32,992
Survive process

1697
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:35,040
Divide that by 1000

1698
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:41,440
And that's 240 -

1699
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:45,280
Barely in there ready to move the lighthouse off some

1700
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:47,072
Or

1701
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:51,424
Now

1702
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:52,960
Get closer to it

1703
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:54,240
Take note

1704
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:56,288
I guess you are not from

1705
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:01,408
That is really hokey what's going on there

1706
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:05,504
Try to make it to all of the things visible to the

1707
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:11,136
Okay

1708
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:14,976
It's not working anywhere near as well as I would have expected

1709
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:19,072
I guess okay what's color coded something

1710
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:25,984
Yeah but it's still it means that they're not interpreting the data right

1711
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:31,616
Say what you got on that

1712
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:38,528
Ice cream is more important

1713
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:41,600
I want to leave it up here mounted

1714
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:46,208
Oh cuz I can't see

1715
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,560
Perfect

1716
02:28:53,632 --> 02:28:57,472
Okay now they're all map to different colors

1717
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:00,032
Okay

1718
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:07,712
Only this one right really close to get really close to it

1719
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:16,160
Okay you can lower the The Thing song

1720
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:17,696
Lowered a little bit

1721
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:24,096
Do you want to hang on

1722
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:33,056
Little bit

1723
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,360
Maybe a little more

1724
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:36,384
Stop

1725
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:40,224
Okay it's not really talking right now maybe back up some

1726
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:45,600
Adam can hold us

1727
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:52,000
I don't know that started tracker again somewhat

1728
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:57,632
What's going on why is that begin that way

1729
02:29:59,168 --> 02:30:01,472
It's tracking her but only sometimes

1730
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:17,600
Yes definitely a lot better and further away with that

1731
02:30:17,856 --> 02:30:18,880
Yeah

1732
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:26,048
Then also one thing to notice if it doesn't receive an update for a long time it just keeps the. Wherever it was

1733
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:29,632
Salad someone clearly got a mess with here

1734
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:33,984
SMS with the handheld controllers at all

1735
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:40,896
Are you may be that much easier for you to do this when we could do

1736
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:50,368
Maybe help open suggest taping all but one sensor

1737
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:52,416
Do we have

1738
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:58,816
Paper that yeah let's do that let's let's keep trying

1739
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:05,216
How to do it this way first there's probably something obvious were missing is probably not that hard

1740
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:14,432
Alan says now the disambiguation explodes

1741
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:19,808
Does that while ago presumably when she was up close to it I didn't see

1742
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:28,512
I know the five does not come with those those stands for the lighthouses Charles got those 9 a.m.

1743
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:29,280
Amazon

1744
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:33,120
Oh wait why are some these codes - 1

1745
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:40,032
Is it only the negative one the only negative value

1746
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:43,872
Yeah it looks like the occasionally

1747
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:47,712
Points are jumping to fix blinds away from the top

1748
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:52,832
And left of the display is -1 signify is that life A2 that I'm looking at right now

1749
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,624
This is live data

1750
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:59,488
And that's life

1751
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:06,400
Okay as it showed a negative right now it's this column right here

1752
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:09,472
How does your framer disambiguation

1753
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:11,520
Disambiguate for

1754
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,360
And you can just ignore sensors and software

1755
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:22,784
Just drop out

1756
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:29,440
You know I'm thinking with disambiguation or what he means by that is the he probably talking about the

1757
02:32:29,696 --> 02:32:35,840
Something that looked at the length of time for the really big pulses the really really big pulse

1758
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:42,240
And then figures out which code it is that does that sets the ACO that's the one that's going now

1759
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,520
Negative for some reason

1760
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,384
So take a look at that code is he recommends

1761
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:51,968
Okay so I have

1762
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:56,064
The light object sensor 80 - 1

1763
02:32:56,320 --> 02:33:02,464
Michael says that's what it is I'm an idiot I actually I wrote

1764
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:08,096
That sends a negative one on a person

1765
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:11,680
Is that really what I did

1766
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,520
Here

1767
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:20,640
123's the third thing

1768
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:24,992
Okay so that is the right thing

1769
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:31,648
That makes sense it's only the negative one it's it's only negative one when it actually does the first week flashed indicate

1770
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:33,184
Like the Flash

1771
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:38,304
Okay

1772
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:43,936
That's okay that's really weird too because I'm looking at the data and it looks great

1773
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:45,216
Like

1774
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:47,264
Look at all of this wonderful data

1775
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:49,056
It's just pouring in

1776
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:57,504
Why isn't it updating this I probably have something just wrong with my display code

1777
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:01,088
3212 sting

1778
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:02,880
Suggestion here

1779
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:05,952
When you get close

1780
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:09,536
Get wide wide enough to look like sinks

1781
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:10,560
?

1782
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:14,912
Know if you were really close the rotor I guess they would be wide

1783
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:21,312
I'll print out the actual the sweet time for that

1784
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:29,248
Frozen's you're right in front of the thingy and we're going to get data with me running around in front of it you think maybe

1785
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:33,856
That works too plugged in

1786
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:47,936
Where do you want to put it sure I'll print out somebody's time timeline

1787
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,728
Maybe over here

1788
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:59,456
Oh you know what I think the disintegrator is doing the right job

1789
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:05,856
Because if it was not doing the right

1790
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:12,256
Rats nest of cables causing problems here

1791
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:16,096
What did I'm plugged in

1792
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:22,496
Oh yeah

1793
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:28,896
And there goes my phone

1794
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:31,200
Does it feel good

1795
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:46,560
Yeah that was also Adams arm the other Lighthouse you realize

1796
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:49,888
Yeah that would have thought though

1797
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:53,984
I'd rather step on Charleston cyber the tire

1798
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:58,080
Okay well I'll see do I still have connection

1799
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:59,872
I do still have connection

1800
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:02,944
So is this again

1801
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:09,344
Back there

1802
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:15,744
Alter running low on battery because it can't charge and stream at the same have a

1803
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:26,752
Oh no it needs to be connected to the computer to provide data

1804
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:31,616
Percent locked up

1805
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:38,272
Three remote sings I think the disintegrator is working okay

1806
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:44,672
Also if anybody knows how to actually go through old chat records on YouTube

1807
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:51,072
Audi super sweet okay so maybe if you want to move around a little bit

1808
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:02,848
I can't really see the screen anymore

1809
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:06,432
I mean it still broken

1810
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:13,088
Pass take a look at that

1811
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:16,672
What's going on there

1812
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:23,840
Ben says that the HBK does include a tool that makes the open scad model someone uploaded

1813
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:30,496
I don't know what that means wait a minute are you going to dig me cuz like if somebody else uses their hdk to do something for me to look at

1814
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:37,152
No I'm sorry made a reference saying that I'm just I'm I'm worried about

1815
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:38,176
Like a

1816
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:40,224
Somehow being

1817
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:42,784
Owned by Valve fi

1818
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,832
Use any aspect of the hdk

1819
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:55,840
Okay I'm going to cancel this right now

1820
02:37:56,096 --> 02:38:02,240
So you shouldn't really close to get really close and then we'll see if we can have him big Unity

1821
02:38:02,496 --> 02:38:03,264
Is today

1822
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:07,616
Do you going to go there that's too close maybe a foot back okay stop

1823
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:09,408
Okay

1824
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:17,856
I'm going with yeah I would not be able to tell what's going on be able to disambiguation it so

1825
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:19,392
Dominican step like another

1826
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:22,208
Foot or two back or three or four

1827
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:27,840
Okay that's probably a good distance

1828
02:38:28,352 --> 02:38:32,448
And yes the daytime seeing would indicate that is a good distance

1829
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:37,312
Disambiguation Arisen totally wrong though

1830
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:40,384
Greater than

1831
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,176
2100

1832
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:58,304
I seriously come on come back you can do it

1833
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:01,376
Okay try moving around

1834
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:11,360
No no no it's anything farther away but it's still closed

1835
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:13,920
Hey now it's working

1836
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:14,944
I was closed

1837
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:18,016
It's still weird though

1838
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:23,136
Huh

1839
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:27,232
Also I don't even know it's Thursday to come in up here and I don't know what's up with that

1840
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:29,792
I can't

1841
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:33,120
That's okay we got some more info there

1842
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:37,472
Cast my comment that are get rid of that

1843
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:39,520
Here

1844
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:42,336
SA

1845
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:49,504
Okay try now

1846
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:59,488
I still beta come in up there and I don't know what it's deal is

1847
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:06,656
He had been reiterated that the dump close

1848
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:12,288
Laser sweeps wider than sinkhole

1849
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:15,616
Probably what

1850
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:18,688
Problems up close

1851
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:23,808
Yeah sodium

1852
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:25,600
Hi Mom

1853
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:32,000
But I'm also curious what the deal is with these pulses appear

1854
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:38,400
So she should stand back until your code is a lot more sophisticated

1855
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:40,704
I have no problem with him calling you

1856
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:47,104
Don't even go farther back just gotten back from Thalia code is a little more

1857
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:52,224
Oh yeah and Allen

1858
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:59,648
They need a Time angle tracking disambiguous

1859
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:06,048
Viva pulse but it's at the wrong time that I know that it's not a pulse but it's rather actually part of the laser sweet poke

1860
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,840
Oh that looks cool

1861
02:41:08,352 --> 02:41:14,496
I still don't understand what's going on with the data ending up in these Corners here

1862
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:20,128
Kind of. Kind of leaving trails

1863
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:24,992
You know what I can put this inside your eyeball and then we'll see what

1864
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:28,064
Yeah and then I can see where I'm actually looking

1865
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:30,880
I don't even know

1866
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:36,512
Oh Oh you mean if I put the camera inside your eyeball

1867
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:38,560
Whatever it is

1868
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:45,472
Okay so what am I looking at here why is the data coming in over here sometimes

1869
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:03,648
How to learn to program without Nordstrom's, Google and YouTube and colleges

1870
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:11,072
Before I even started to even think that I understood anything about programming it was

1871
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:12,864
Over a year

1872
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:15,424
Definitely

1873
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:20,800
And that was hot with having Donuts tutorials

1874
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:30,272
Does it only come in weird places when she's

1875
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:38,208
I'm sorry hold on I really want to figure this out

1876
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:41,792
That we have

1877
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:45,120
Okay I'll kill it

1878
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:47,936
Remove

1879
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:51,520
Block user

1880
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:54,336
Does not just block it for you

1881
02:42:56,896 --> 02:42:57,664
Remove

1882
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:06,112
I mean that's that's new

1883
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:10,720
Hayki move around some

1884
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:18,656
Tell me to go in and out or just up and down looking on the wrong side of this

1885
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,288
Okay try now

1886
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:30,176
I stopped

1887
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:33,504
I really need to just display other data

1888
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:36,576
Okay try now

1889
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:42,208
Still not working those datapoints that's like

1890
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,792
I need is more.

1891
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:55,008
It seems that the scattered points are ones that haven't received data but we don't entirely know why some of them are shoe

1892
02:43:55,264 --> 02:43:56,288
Shooting to the edge of the screen

1893
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:59,872
Yes clearly something is dumb in my code here

1894
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,920
Don't know what it is though

1895
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:05,248
Okay try again

1896
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:09,088
Stop

1897
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:18,304
Moist towelette asks why we're doing this and that's perennial question

1898
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:21,120
Copy paste to a to answer but

1899
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:24,704
Yeah we don't even really have a good answer okay move some

1900
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:30,080
Oh okay so the really Bizarro data is

1901
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:34,432
Is where it mistakenly thinks

1902
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:41,088
A pulse is actually a sweet

1903
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:48,256
That's easy to make not be a problem

1904
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:57,728
How good luck Arnie

1905
02:44:57,984 --> 02:45:00,288
Least it's Sunday tomorrow

1906
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:02,336
Hopefully enough to work

1907
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:18,208
Turn it down more

1908
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:25,632
I won't be getting around some of it

1909
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:32,032
Though it looked kind of choppy on your guys screen I do want to show you this is like buttery-smooth on my screen

1910
02:45:36,384 --> 02:45:40,480
Okay so what do you chords are is the the

1911
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:46,880
From what I think is going on I'm pretty sure I've at least kind of December still not right though

1912
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:48,160
Something's going on

1913
02:45:49,952 --> 02:45:56,096
It is a couple that they're doing and also what is that

1914
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:58,912
Let's see how far I can get out

1915
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:08,895
Wow Guild of you is like huge

1916
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:24,255
I'm going to take this off and keep it so no I don't think you're going to get any date out there

1917
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:34,751
I'm not really reverse-engineering now is a day or it's a little bit different

1918
02:46:35,007 --> 02:46:36,031
A step

1919
02:46:36,287 --> 02:46:42,431
In the reverse-engineer slowly go back and let's make

1920
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:44,735
Really was tracking it okay

1921
02:46:46,271 --> 02:46:47,039
Crazy

1922
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:54,207
I didn't get a hit my limit because this couch like

1923
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:57,279
Wherever there got in the way

1924
02:46:57,535 --> 02:47:02,143
Okay so now that we've gotten a little bit better disambiguation

1925
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:04,703
And figured out like which pulses were which

1926
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:08,031
I'm thinking it might be time for me to do another dump

1927
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:13,919
I'm so just wondering is anybody in this Channel right now that's up for actually trying to do some of this data analysis

1928
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:15,967
Cuz that would be super sweet

1929
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:27,999
Now we probably don't have a date for the next stream yet these things just kind of happened

1930
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:34,143
Okay so I'm going to label these as l

1931
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:36,959
I'm going to label this one as X

1932
02:47:37,983 --> 02:47:42,335
I'm going to label this one is L and this one is why

1933
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:44,639
Okay ru

1934
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:51,295
Wi-Fi disconnect from the hmd without shutting it down it gets all cranky okay

1935
02:47:57,439 --> 02:48:02,559
I don't think motion is right at the right now I think the headset just sitting still on the floor is probably the best

1936
02:48:07,423 --> 02:48:10,239
Rapport

1937
02:48:13,567 --> 02:48:16,383
Can you closer

1938
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:19,711
So if you just dropped the height of the

1939
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:26,111
Diamond like so it's more Street on

1940
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,391
And then

1941
02:48:31,743 --> 02:48:33,791
Put an ice cream bowl under it

1942
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:39,167
Are boxes just point that at this

1943
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:43,263
You have to loosen that stuff

1944
02:48:44,543 --> 02:48:50,175
Try scaling up what values

1945
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:54,527
Are such a

1946
02:48:56,831 --> 02:49:02,975
Scaling-up Oso you can actually see the details of what's going on in there so that it's easier to see the differences

1947
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:03,743
Sensors

1948
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:07,583
Okay I can do that so it looks like it's

1949
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:12,703
Body-wise are about 160,000

1950
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:32,671
The exes

1951
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:35,231
70000

1952
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:50,847
About 180,000

1953
02:49:57,759 --> 02:49:59,295
480 -

1954
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,855
Oh am I doing wrong

1955
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:06,463
Oh actually shouldn't be 480 - for that

1956
02:50:14,143 --> 02:50:16,959
Taxes actually minus

1957
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:24,127
Yeah I don't see why wouldn't it be

1958
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:28,479
I don't know who endgame is a company

1959
02:50:28,735 --> 02:50:34,879
What is a big company no I mean if you want I have the others

1960
02:50:35,135 --> 02:50:41,279
You'll be fine.

1961
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:43,071
Is it happening

1962
02:50:43,583 --> 02:50:44,863
I think he wants to show her

1963
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:54,335
My YouTube Channel logo

1964
02:50:54,847 --> 02:50:55,871
Oh

1965
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:58,943
If you are worried about the shirt

1966
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,991
Well I just know for legal reasons

1967
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:08,415
Hoist a ladder

1968
02:51:08,671 --> 02:51:09,695
Asks if we're

1969
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:15,583
Reverse engineering software bit or the Fitbit physical or we're doing all our own software

1970
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:25,823
No idea here

1971
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:31,455
Figure out what the physical B are doing so we can write our own software for it by rmean Charles's

1972
02:51:50,143 --> 02:51:50,911
Strawberry cookies

1973
02:51:51,423 --> 02:51:52,959
Not right now

1974
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:54,751
Thank you though

1975
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:55,775
You're welcome

1976
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:12,415
Michael suggest bringing reflective objects into the scene when looking at the data see how it changes its interesting

1977
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:15,487
I don't want to mess with anything like that right now

1978
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:16,767
Sorry trip

1979
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:30,079
Matthew asks how did we all get together on this group project

1980
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:34,687
We've all known each other through various business ventures and through

1981
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:35,967
Through

1982
02:52:36,223 --> 02:52:38,015
Let me know how you know.

1983
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:42,623
I would assume magfest his magfest Rings many people together

1984
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:45,183
You haven't been to magfest to go

1985
02:52:46,207 --> 02:52:52,351
Okay guys that's what it looks like when you can just move it around little itty-bitty area

1986
02:52:58,751 --> 02:53:01,311
Hot date is so rock solid

1987
02:53:01,823 --> 02:53:04,127
I know other than it like losing tracking briefly

1988
02:53:04,383 --> 02:53:05,919
Play ephrem occlusions

1989
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:08,479
And like you know whatever

1990
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:22,303
Do you want to just put it down now

1991
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:24,095
Oh okay that works

1992
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:28,191
Concentra it until I thought of plaintiff

1993
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:37,407
Exploding

1994
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:43,295
It's hard to get it to look like it's not changing. That all

1995
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:49,951
Because it wraps around the headset you can tell we are tipping around so we can see the ones on the battle

1996
02:53:50,207 --> 02:53:54,559
Yeah let's do that. Oh yeah

1997
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:58,143
So you can see them around some

1998
02:53:59,167 --> 02:54:04,287
Stop tracking the data that's over here on the side of the headset it's towards me right now it looks like

1999
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:06,847
Yeah I can't because you're there

2000
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:07,615
Instead of

2001
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:14,271
So I guess monitors though it keeps it in his last known good place

2002
02:54:14,527 --> 02:54:17,087
Yeah I don't have any

2003
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:18,367
Yeah that is my tool

2004
02:54:25,791 --> 02:54:26,559
Aliens

2005
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:48,831
Wait how did this work

2006
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:53,951
Okay whatever now it's right

2007
02:54:54,463 --> 02:55:00,607
Alex we're not we haven't I guess technically yes we've isolated the perspective of 1

2008
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:05,215
On Lighthouse but this is because we've started back from the very very

2009
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:10,591
Bottom of how this whole thing works first figuring out how the Vive communicates its sensor data

2010
02:55:11,103 --> 02:55:17,247
Then figuring out what that sensor de to means and now we're taking that sensor data and putting it to some kind of picture

2011
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:23,647
And then the next step is to figure out where the lighthouse is in 3D space relative to the vibe

2012
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:30,559
And then from that we can figure out knowing that the lighthouses ficked where the five is

2013
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:36,191
3D space and then from there we can do interesting things not to be that's the goal

2014
02:55:37,215 --> 02:55:39,007
Get be interesting things phase

2015
02:55:40,031 --> 02:55:40,799
Track me at 5

2016
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:43,615
Misspoken Charles

2017
02:55:44,127 --> 02:55:46,943
I have you heard it for him

2018
02:55:49,759 --> 02:55:52,063
Oh great treat great Franco

2019
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:57,695
Cotton gray cotton Greg are you Greg cotton are you here is that

2020
02:55:57,951 --> 02:56:04,095
That greasy

2021
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:10,495
I don't know how long ago that was. We're still on

2022
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:20,479
That's exactly what our issue is been and it's just

2023
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:22,783
I know this really matters

2024
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:27,135
Just kind of fur appearance's sake right now but it is producing pretty pictures

2025
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:34,559
Yeah for the sake of like that I just want to sit here and marble for a minute

2026
02:56:34,815 --> 02:56:35,583
All of your data

2027
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:47,615
On this nothing was asking

2028
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:55,039
If we hide sensor points that aren't updated right so whenever we were rotating that thing around it look like it was

2029
02:56:55,295 --> 02:56:57,087
Is leaving the data points and like

2030
02:56:57,343 --> 02:57:02,719
The last known space but they were and then whenever they disappeared from visual they just don't like

2031
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:04,255
Stayed

2032
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:05,791
And the last

2033
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:08,863
Play so they're not going away right now

2034
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:11,167
I will soon

2035
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:18,591
Michael in my experience with camera bright based tracking systems in a marine environment

2036
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:20,895
For Navy purposes

2037
02:57:21,151 --> 02:57:27,295
I'll take the lighthouses thank you very much lighthouses are way better weird your marker go

2038
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:33,695
Sorry I'm horrible it's right here

2039
02:57:33,951 --> 02:57:36,255
Why

2040
02:57:36,767 --> 02:57:38,559
Why anyway

2041
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:47,519
I need reasons

2042
02:57:47,775 --> 02:57:53,919
No

2043
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:59,295
Andy can you get in the way of the light

2044
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:04,671
The way of the headset

2045
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:08,255
Oh my goodness

2046
02:58:13,119 --> 02:58:13,887
Move

2047
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:15,167
There we go

2048
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:20,287
Okay that's totally not what I would expect it to happen but

2049
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:24,895
Oh I'm dumb

2050
02:58:42,303 --> 02:58:45,375
What I'm doing wrong why just fading to White that makes no sense

2051
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:51,007
When you get in the way of Fades to white instead of black

2052
02:58:55,359 --> 02:58:56,639
What's heading to White

2053
02:59:03,551 --> 02:59:08,159
I see caller right and then when you hold it they fade to white instead of black

2054
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:10,207
White and then black

2055
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:16,863
Oh

2056
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:19,679
I got it backwards it's 100 -

2057
02:59:22,751 --> 02:59:25,055
Yeah that should do it okay try it now

2058
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:25,823
Visible

2059
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:32,479
Yes okay

2060
02:59:32,735 --> 02:59:38,879
I think we're at the point where we should start collecting all my gosh

2061
02:59:39,135 --> 02:59:39,903
It's so smooth

2062
02:59:42,975 --> 02:59:46,047
Oh and it glows when you hide them

2063
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:53,471
Oh my gosh if we just keep getting this distracted we're never going to get any further

2064
02:59:53,727 --> 02:59:56,799
Is fun why are gooeys fun

2065
02:59:57,055 --> 02:59:58,079
Because they're pretty

2066
02:59:58,591 --> 03:00:00,895
By the way Mikey are you alright

2067
03:00:05,759 --> 03:00:08,575
Okay I think we should get some more data

2068
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:12,927
Haha I look so cool

2069
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:18,559
That was interesting

2070
03:00:19,071 --> 03:00:24,191
Whoa what do cuz it's tracking in the one dimension but not the other

2071
03:00:25,215 --> 03:00:31,359
That makes sense

2072
03:00:31,615 --> 03:00:34,175
This is down in the corner of its field of view

2073
03:00:34,431 --> 03:00:40,319
Do we have only wants to come by

2074
03:00:41,343 --> 03:00:43,391
I keep going lower

2075
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:47,487
Running for no fade

2076
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:51,071
Wait they're voting for no fade

2077
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:55,679
Oh why do you want no fade like

2078
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:57,983
Knowledge of when it's there when it's not there

2079
03:00:59,007 --> 03:01:00,799
Well if we don't say it it just

2080
03:01:01,055 --> 03:01:07,199
Sticks around for forever immediately disappear

2081
03:01:07,455 --> 03:01:09,503
Immediately cuz like Witnesses

2082
03:01:09,759 --> 03:01:14,623
The updated the visual display is not locked to the update of the data points so

2083
03:01:15,391 --> 03:01:21,535
I'll make it fade really fast though like 5 frames

2084
03:01:22,303 --> 03:01:23,583
You're doing 100 there

2085
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:24,863
100 frames

2086
03:01:25,887 --> 03:01:27,167
I can't right now

2087
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:33,823
Your turn omigosh we can see you wait waves and front like wave your hand in front

2088
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:38,943
That is nice

2089
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:46,111
Unwittingly

2090
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:47,391
Okay

2091
03:01:47,647 --> 03:01:53,791
Knowing how close to the base station it is that's all I'm aligning its 02 straight on as you can

2092
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:56,095
If you wanted to play with play with it right now

2093
03:01:56,351 --> 03:02:02,239
That's basically done by measuring the distance between these points can you move it closer and you'll see they get bigger

2094
03:02:02,495 --> 03:02:07,615
Method of the width between the broken

2095
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:14,015
As you get further away this whole image will get smaller and that's how you would calculate the distance

2096
03:02:16,575 --> 03:02:22,719
It's not actually measuring time-of-flight right Springs of one thing I don't know if Alan if you're still here

2097
03:02:22,975 --> 03:02:29,119
One thing I was curious that looks really cool when you Valeri Al-Anon one thing I was curious about

2098
03:02:29,375 --> 03:02:35,519
One of the things from the lighthouse redox people they think that you have a fair bit of analog circuitry that kind of

2099
03:02:35,775 --> 03:02:41,919
Resolves the length of the pulses and I'm curious if you think not having like the the diode in

2100
03:02:42,175 --> 03:02:48,319
The greater the whatever you called on the output to prevent a whole bunch of pulses but instead if I were to interpret that and software

2101
03:02:48,575 --> 03:02:54,719
If I'd be able to get better information about when the edges begin and end just a thought

2102
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:57,279
I'm toying with trying to do that but

2103
03:02:57,535 --> 03:03:03,679
For all I know with everything else that you guys keep doing the super clever you probably figured out something way better than that

2104
03:03:03,935 --> 03:03:10,079
If you can get behind me you can see the screen off sink

2105
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:13,407
Ono is this off sync though

2106
03:03:19,295 --> 03:03:23,135
TV

2107
03:03:23,391 --> 03:03:29,535
The one of the things a little bit weird here is the DNC picture that you see here is actually the insteon on

2108
03:03:29,791 --> 03:03:30,815
John Adams computer

2109
03:03:31,071 --> 03:03:34,143
To my computer so everything you're seeing on this is

2110
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:36,191
A little bit behind

2111
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:42,591
What reality is Lighthouse you should totally

2112
03:03:42,847 --> 03:03:48,991
Then if and only if I'm going to implement it on the esp3

2113
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:50,015
32

2114
03:03:52,575 --> 03:03:56,159
Does that mean VSP lighthouse

2115
03:03:57,183 --> 03:04:03,327
Call maybe maybe we have a different definition for the term ESP Lighthouse means

2116
03:04:03,583 --> 03:04:05,887
Right that's what my tsp lighthouse

2117
03:04:08,703 --> 03:04:11,519
I'm trying to figure out how I can play the drums

2118
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:17,919
But it doesn't really have a nice lovers I can use for like my finger sticking

2119
03:04:18,175 --> 03:04:19,199
Add time

2120
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:26,111
Got to get your unpaid expressive advertisements

2121
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:27,135
Context you mean it

2122
03:04:27,391 --> 03:04:33,535
What I wanted 200 no I do not want to take the analog values at 48 MHz coming into the

2123
03:04:33,791 --> 03:04:39,935
The photodiodes I did want to look at is just the Amplified photodiode thing with a like a Schmitt trigger gauge

2124
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:45,567
So every single pulse at the 1.8 MHz I'll be able to actually see the individual pulses

2125
03:04:48,127 --> 03:04:54,271
This video is not brought to you by espressive I just think they're that cool

2126
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:58,879
It is actually brought to you by unity Technologies

2127
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:05,535
Units hyphen named before Unity with a thing

2128
03:05:07,071 --> 03:05:12,191
I don't know actually 2005 before Eric

2129
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:19,615
Yeah I think that 2005 was before unity game engine was the thing you were called Unity still hope he gets bought

2130
03:05:19,871 --> 03:05:21,919
The new name

2131
03:05:22,431 --> 03:05:24,479
Easier to tell over the phone

2132
03:05:24,991 --> 03:05:30,111
Is this someone else's

2133
03:05:30,879 --> 03:05:32,927
So

2134
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:37,535
You need the envelope timing or else the performance will be terrible

2135
03:05:38,047 --> 03:05:39,327
Envelope timing

2136
03:05:40,607 --> 03:05:42,911
I think you guys have a word for this

2137
03:05:43,423 --> 03:05:46,239
That is not in my vocabulary for this project right now

2138
03:05:46,751 --> 03:05:48,543
Found in 2004

2139
03:05:58,015 --> 03:06:04,159
Tell you what I'm going to go record some data now and I'm going to upload it so you guys can all get the data

2140
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:11,583
I thought sitting try to move a little bit to get some more LEDs and you Michael asks what are the second and third integers

2141
03:06:11,839 --> 03:06:14,655
Following the timestamp indicate

2142
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:18,239
You seems the first one is sensor ID

2143
03:06:18,495 --> 03:06:20,543
But the second one is unclear

2144
03:06:23,615 --> 03:06:29,759
Okay so whenever I received a sweep like coming from the the laser on the

2145
03:06:31,039 --> 03:06:33,855
On the lighthouse like

2146
03:06:34,111 --> 03:06:34,879
What

2147
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:41,279
Suggested a much worse name for a new company forwards

2148
03:06:45,375 --> 03:06:47,935
50s

2149
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:50,495
I want that

2150
03:06:51,775 --> 03:06:54,847
I'm going to take this I'm going to update the thread with it

2151
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:56,383
Probably just so you know

2152
03:06:56,639 --> 03:07:02,783
This right here this one thing that you asked about the 012344 a lot more information about that

2153
03:07:03,039 --> 03:07:06,879
What is over at the Lighthouse redox if you look under light emissions

2154
03:07:07,135 --> 03:07:11,487
So that that Wiki there has the information on what the jnk pulses do

2155
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:16,095
Which is based on

2156
03:07:16,351 --> 03:07:20,959
I think was Ben was saying something about that actually matter in a way that I'm confused by

2157
03:07:21,727 --> 03:07:24,031
Cuz I would have expected it to been rotor

2158
03:07:24,543 --> 03:07:26,591
So I don't know

2159
03:07:29,407 --> 03:07:32,735
Oh no I see ya 3000 or 3500

2160
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:39,135
For 4,000 or 4,500 it just ran into funny order so they aren't they are actually the jna

2161
03:07:39,391 --> 03:07:40,159
MK pulses

2162
03:07:43,999 --> 03:07:45,279
JK

2163
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:47,583
Let's take some of the state of for you guys

2164
03:07:49,631 --> 03:07:54,239
Sensor analog Hardware is very important for the system centroid resolution

2165
03:07:55,007 --> 03:07:57,055
No I understand that

2166
03:07:57,311 --> 03:08:01,919
I do understand that the center Hardware the analog Parts going to be important

2167
03:08:02,175 --> 03:08:04,223
What I'm wondering

2168
03:08:07,807 --> 03:08:08,575
Company name

2169
03:08:08,831 --> 03:08:10,111
You only live once

2170
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:11,647
Oh

2171
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:18,047
No More Words

2172
03:08:18,303 --> 03:08:24,447
Uppercase is that is that what you were thinking he meant literally four words all uppercase

2173
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:53,631
Okay

2174
03:08:53,887 --> 03:08:58,751
Then says it's from the Rocket Jump worst Wi-Fi password ever shorts ketchup something

2175
03:08:59,007 --> 03:09:02,079
What I was thinking

2176
03:09:02,335 --> 03:09:08,479
Was like the top diagram there looking at the the individual on-and-off sat the

2177
03:09:08,735 --> 03:09:10,783
Hold on

2178
03:09:15,135 --> 03:09:21,023
Was looking at the individual on-and-off is 1 / 1.8 MHz thing

2179
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:24,351
I can see that very clearly

2180
03:09:25,375 --> 03:09:29,215
But the idea would be to actually look at all of the ons and all of the offs

2181
03:09:29,471 --> 03:09:33,567
When you receiving the high-frequency data and that would include during a sweep

2182
03:09:33,823 --> 03:09:39,967
I don't know if it's actually legit like idea but that's one of the things I was thinking I'm definitely not coming

2183
03:09:40,223 --> 03:09:46,367
Get that for another couple weeks

2184
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:50,719
Island

2185
03:09:51,231 --> 03:09:53,023
Like Ireland

2186
03:09:59,679 --> 03:10:05,823
Okay right now I'm recording some new track data. CSV for you guys so this is the same as before

2187
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:09,919
Keonda

2188
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:16,575
Oh yeah now it's a single Lighthouse and it's pointed straight at the vibe the five is tilted and turned a little bit and all

2189
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:22,975
But the goal for clearly we're not going to get to doing this tonight but the goal for the next couple days

2190
03:10:23,231 --> 03:10:29,375
This is going to be to take the days I'm recording now and the config that I have which is kind of Wrong by the way

2191
03:10:29,631 --> 03:10:35,775
Play Alan and Ben if there's any way to get our config back with like itself

2192
03:10:36,031 --> 03:10:38,591
We want our config back

2193
03:10:38,847 --> 03:10:43,455
Any rate taking this data and figuring out how to

2194
03:10:43,711 --> 03:10:45,759
To do that

2195
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:48,575
Final Street

2196
03:10:48,831 --> 03:10:49,343
Stream

2197
03:10:49,599 --> 03:10:55,743
Bandwidth YouTube allows final stream secret BBC cameras

2198
03:10:56,511 --> 03:11:02,143
Oh that would be neat we have plenty of bandwidth at home we need to do that

2199
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:08,543
Oh like multiple channels that be weird you have one that's just constantly streaming what the Vive cease

2200
03:11:08,799 --> 03:11:14,943
As you like swing it around what is the device serial number

2201
03:11:15,199 --> 03:11:21,343
Where is the bottle you have no idea how much we want this

2202
03:11:21,599 --> 03:11:27,743
Msconfig back nevermind okay

2203
03:11:27,999 --> 03:11:34,143
Well we've got your serial number

2204
03:11:40,031 --> 03:11:41,311
Midnight

2205
03:11:43,615 --> 03:11:45,407
How are you streaming

2206
03:11:50,783 --> 03:11:52,831
Oh hi Mark

2207
03:11:53,343 --> 03:11:59,231
Freezing

2208
03:12:00,511 --> 03:12:06,655
They're using my phone Verizon has really good coverage up here really good coverage I get there

2209
03:12:06,911 --> 03:12:12,543
30 MB down 14 or 15 up but now I'm only getting two and a half

2210
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:14,591
But that's funny

2211
03:12:16,895 --> 03:12:23,039
I'm just wondering is anybody in chat right now who's actually willing to take a look at the state and try to help process it

2212
03:12:23,295 --> 03:12:29,183
And by the way bonus points if you do it in C in a way that I can speed up

2213
03:12:30,463 --> 03:12:36,607
Actually wait no it doesn't even matter if we're trying to find location lighthouses this could be in like any language because once

2214
03:12:36,863 --> 03:12:43,007
Is the calibration is only done once once we have the calibration we know where the lighthouses then it's

2215
03:12:43,263 --> 03:12:49,407
Easiest pie from there because once that date is provided I'm pretty sure we can use that dated then to go

2216
03:12:49,663 --> 03:12:52,735
Figure out where the vibe is and everything else

2217
03:12:54,783 --> 03:13:00,927
I was leaning over formica shouldn't be leaning over for the mic at all and totally hear you from there okay well I move away from the mic to breathe

2218
03:13:01,183 --> 03:13:01,951
So

2219
03:13:02,207 --> 03:13:04,511
Well they can hear you breathing in anyway

2220
03:13:08,351 --> 03:13:12,703
That's not me breathing in

2221
03:13:19,103 --> 03:13:21,151
Somebody asked a question

2222
03:13:21,407 --> 03:13:23,199
Is Java acceptable for what

2223
03:13:25,247 --> 03:13:31,391
Don't want to take Java code

2224
03:13:31,647 --> 03:13:35,487
Cuz I don't want to have to cuz not like you even have Java

2225
03:13:37,023 --> 03:13:43,167
Oh yes I'm just asking I guess for the calibration but you know python

2226
03:13:49,567 --> 03:13:55,711
Someone was asking what the config file was and what does it do when Lars says that we Act

2227
03:13:55,967 --> 03:13:59,039
Accidentally are device yes we accidentally the whole device

2228
03:13:59,295 --> 03:14:02,623
Okay Paul II macaroni with you no no

2229
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:04,415
No Java

2230
03:14:04,671 --> 03:14:06,207
Do I have mono

2231
03:14:09,023 --> 03:14:15,167
Do you want I have mono so if you do write it in c-sharp and you use like only the most basic

2232
03:14:15,423 --> 03:14:19,007
Basic things all except C sharp

2233
03:14:20,287 --> 03:14:25,663
No Purl nobody will be able to read it and understand what is going on

2234
03:14:26,431 --> 03:14:28,735
I can at least read C sharp

2235
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:40,255
LOL

2236
03:14:43,071 --> 03:14:45,631
Okay Mack 33

2237
03:14:46,143 --> 03:14:49,983
Oh wait what

2238
03:14:53,055 --> 03:14:58,687
No stop just seriously guys CC Sharpie no PHP

2239
03:14:58,943 --> 03:15:01,247
Python that kind of thing

2240
03:15:01,503 --> 03:15:07,647
Preferably C or C plus plus preferably State the tasks

2241
03:15:07,903 --> 03:15:14,047
Typically so this is what what I'm hoping you guys will be able to do over the next next week I think I'm going to

2242
03:15:14,303 --> 03:15:20,447
I try to make these live streams on the weekends though I won't be able to make every weekend I think I'm going to

2243
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:26,847
Avoid them during the week is that was not as much fun your goal will be able to take

2244
03:15:27,103 --> 03:15:28,127
This new tracking

2245
03:15:30,687 --> 03:15:31,455
Okay

2246
03:15:31,711 --> 03:15:33,247
Whoa what

2247
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:35,807
Is going to be able to take this new track data

2248
03:15:36,063 --> 03:15:38,623
Which contains the the

2249
03:15:38,879 --> 03:15:43,743
X and Y or a J & K

2250
03:15:43,999 --> 03:15:45,023
Codes

2251
03:15:45,279 --> 03:15:46,815
For the headset

2252
03:15:47,071 --> 03:15:52,191
Coming from a single Lighthouse so the idea is that if we look at this picture

2253
03:15:53,471 --> 03:15:56,799
Let's do that again this

2254
03:15:57,055 --> 03:16:03,199
He said and then brought up the picture here if we take a look at this. This contains is the

2255
03:16:03,455 --> 03:16:07,039
The X and Y are the J&K codes for where all of the LEDs are

2256
03:16:07,551 --> 03:16:13,695
And that leading sorry of where all of the LEDs are and

2257
03:16:13,951 --> 03:16:17,791
Take this config file although it's not perfect

2258
03:16:19,583 --> 03:16:24,959
This initial hmb data. Whatever it is away that's the wrong thing

2259
03:16:25,215 --> 03:16:27,007
And

2260
03:16:27,775 --> 03:16:29,567
That's one hmd points

2261
03:16:32,383 --> 03:16:33,663
No I want to click on it

2262
03:16:35,199 --> 03:16:36,991
Why can't I click on that

2263
03:16:40,831 --> 03:16:42,111
Uploading

2264
03:16:45,183 --> 03:16:47,231
Whatever I'm going to just upload that again

2265
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:59,519
Buses are curious why there's one extra sensor on the right presumably in that

2266
03:16:59,775 --> 03:17:01,311
That image scroll up

2267
03:17:04,383 --> 03:17:05,919
Such as you talking about

2268
03:17:06,687 --> 03:17:12,831
Not the one you made the months

2269
03:17:16,927 --> 03:17:18,207
Did he delete it

2270
03:17:18,463 --> 03:17:19,231
Oh here it is

2271
03:17:20,255 --> 03:17:24,095
I don't see any others

2272
03:17:24,351 --> 03:17:25,887
Alex Wright yeah

2273
03:17:26,143 --> 03:17:27,167
So

2274
03:17:29,215 --> 03:17:30,239
This is the

2275
03:17:32,287 --> 03:17:33,823
Dated a tracking here

2276
03:17:35,615 --> 03:17:41,759
Any rate your goal will be to take this data in the the new track data

2277
03:17:42,015 --> 03:17:48,159
And use the initial hmd data in order to generate or to calculate the location of the

2278
03:17:48,415 --> 03:17:54,559
The camera on the light so

2279
03:18:02,751 --> 03:18:08,895
The goal will be to based on the lighthouse data or specific times

2280
03:18:10,431 --> 03:18:13,759
Look I'm not good at this

2281
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:18,623
Figure out the the position of the lighthouse

2282
03:18:19,135 --> 03:18:23,231
From the position or the timing that we get and the the

2283
03:18:25,279 --> 03:18:27,071
Whatever it is the

2284
03:18:27,327 --> 03:18:33,471
The positions of all the photodiodes on the hmd

2285
03:18:33,727 --> 03:18:36,543
Actually get the coating that tonight but that's definitely not happening

2286
03:18:40,639 --> 03:18:46,783
Anything else guys you can think of

2287
03:18:47,039 --> 03:18:49,087
Actually like

2288
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:52,927
123456789

2289
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:58,047
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 sensors on one side

2290
03:18:58,303 --> 03:19:04,447
Yasobi 16 + 16

2291
03:19:04,703 --> 03:19:07,775
It's not being directly head-on with the camera is all

2292
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:17,503
I don't know what the normal to be used for I'm sure that Ben and Alan can tell us more about what

2293
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:21,599
What they're used for I would assume that they're used for occlusion as in

2294
03:19:21,855 --> 03:19:25,439
If a given sensor is pointed away from a camera

2295
03:19:25,695 --> 03:19:31,839
We can ignore it so then what that would mean it's like if you had a mirror or something reflective on one side

2296
03:19:32,095 --> 03:19:38,239
Side of the room and it was reflecting the pulse code it would be able to throw that out I'm guessing I don't I don't actually know if that's the case

2297
03:19:39,519 --> 03:19:41,823
That would that would also work for a while

2298
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:45,919
Going guy when I mention using this for Naval purposes that

2299
03:19:46,175 --> 03:19:50,015
That would be how you would make it not show up when it bounces off the water

2300
03:19:50,527 --> 03:19:51,551
The lasers

2301
03:19:59,999 --> 03:20:03,071
Just some ideas that I had about the state of

2302
03:20:03,327 --> 03:20:09,471
It's like saying like the top picture if you're if you're spot-on like if your angle and everything of where the LIE

2303
03:20:09,727 --> 03:20:10,751
Lighthouses pointed

2304
03:20:11,007 --> 03:20:15,359
Matches up with the dissenters and you know you have to move the lighthouse Inn

2305
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:19,199
If say it's off to one side you're going to have to slide the lighthouse down

2306
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:22,783
But to make things a little bit more confusing

2307
03:20:23,551 --> 03:20:24,831
Just like this

2308
03:20:25,087 --> 03:20:26,367
And

2309
03:20:32,767 --> 03:20:36,351
And say the problem is actually rotation

2310
03:20:36,607 --> 03:20:42,751
It actually looks the same but it is going to be different because you're going to have more than two

2311
03:20:43,007 --> 03:20:46,847
Points to resolve so that should help resolve the difference between

2312
03:20:47,103 --> 03:20:50,687
A rotation and a translation

2313
03:20:59,647 --> 03:21:05,791
Can you guys think of anything else or should I mean I'm not going I know I'm not like awake enough to try to

2314
03:21:06,047 --> 03:21:07,583
This is going to be easy

2315
03:21:07,839 --> 03:21:09,119
We down like that

2316
03:21:09,631 --> 03:21:11,935
There are pretty lights and stuff

2317
03:21:12,191 --> 03:21:15,519
Yeah ice cream

2318
03:21:15,775 --> 03:21:18,335
I want to question a lot of questions

2319
03:21:19,103 --> 03:21:20,127
Probably

2320
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:22,687
Love the same questions when people come in

2321
03:21:34,207 --> 03:21:36,767
We're only using the light sensor data right now

2322
03:21:37,535 --> 03:21:43,679
Right now the goal is to use the light sensor data to figure out where the lighthouse is in 3

2323
03:21:43,935 --> 03:21:44,447
3D space

2324
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:48,799
Ck2 says this will not be easy

2325
03:21:51,103 --> 03:21:56,735
Alan I know this won't be easy but I tried doing this before with the webcam

2326
03:21:56,991 --> 03:21:59,551
And I discovered how awful that was

2327
03:21:59,807 --> 03:22:01,855
And I almost got it to work

2328
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:03,647
So

2329
03:22:04,159 --> 03:22:07,999
This can't be anywhere near as bad as a webcam

2330
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:09,023
Because

2331
03:22:09,279 --> 03:22:13,375
A webcam has Barrel Distortion and everything else messed up

2332
03:22:14,143 --> 03:22:15,423
These lighthouses

2333
03:22:15,679 --> 03:22:16,703
Are beautiful

2334
03:22:17,215 --> 03:22:19,007
There is no Barrel distortion

2335
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:21,055
There is no none of this mess

2336
03:22:21,311 --> 03:22:23,103
It simply tells you the angle

2337
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:28,991
In basically X&Y coming out of the lighthouse where a given thing is

2338
03:22:29,247 --> 03:22:30,783
And that's beautiful

2339
03:22:31,295 --> 03:22:33,599
That's so beautiful

2340
03:22:35,135 --> 03:22:36,415
Is it too loud

2341
03:22:36,671 --> 03:22:37,951
I don't think so okay

2342
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:44,095
3D space relative

2343
03:22:44,607 --> 03:22:46,911
Harassing where in three space would you say

2344
03:22:47,167 --> 03:22:50,495
That you'd be measuring the lighthouse relative to

2345
03:22:52,287 --> 03:22:57,919
Collective live his dream yes it is to pull out my hair

2346
03:22:58,175 --> 03:23:03,551
I'm sorry what did you ask

2347
03:23:03,807 --> 03:23:07,903
Coordinate system the lighthouses would be measured in based upon this data

2348
03:23:08,415 --> 03:23:11,999
How's the lighthouse would be measured so assume that

2349
03:23:12,255 --> 03:23:18,399
Is I think the degenerate case would be assuming that the the the points on the hmdr

2350
03:23:18,655 --> 03:23:19,935
Global space

2351
03:23:20,191 --> 03:23:26,335
So that this would be assuming that the headset is at 0-0 and pointed whichever way the headset is is pointed

2352
03:23:26,591 --> 03:23:31,967
I'm in global space XYZ first second third assuming that

2353
03:23:32,735 --> 03:23:38,879
Figure out where the camera is and where it's pointed and I guess I could use a quaternion or oil

2354
03:23:39,135 --> 03:23:45,279
Miller angles wouldn't quite make sense it would have to be like a simultaneous transform of both X and Y in the Euler angles

2355
03:23:45,535 --> 03:23:51,679
Which is an Oiler angles then it's just X&Y microphone

2356
03:23:51,935 --> 03:23:58,079
Then I can talk to you guys hear ye

2357
03:23:58,335 --> 03:24:04,479
Curve of The Bean

2358
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:12,927
Be referring to with the white whale

2359
03:24:13,183 --> 03:24:19,327
But I just don't think it is we're doing I don't think exact enough stuff that we need to worry about that we're not doing like molecular

2360
03:24:19,583 --> 03:24:23,423
Spectroscopy and have to worry about these little tiny things we're just trying to get like

2361
03:24:24,191 --> 03:24:28,031
A general data down to probably what like a centimeter Maybe

2362
03:24:28,287 --> 03:24:33,407
Well we're going to have to get the lighthouse position well may I get to cm

2363
03:24:34,175 --> 03:24:36,991
What is centimeter be good enough

2364
03:24:37,503 --> 03:24:39,807
Englewood matter a lot

2365
03:24:40,063 --> 03:24:46,207
A lot position I guess it would matter a lot but not a whole lot

2366
03:24:46,463 --> 03:24:52,607
Stop like these right light waves are NM AR-15 right and it's a very least like

2367
03:24:52,863 --> 03:24:57,215
Gitaran the data I don't know if you guys were watching today too but it's not very much Jitter like

2368
03:24:57,471 --> 03:25:00,287
I don't know if it's really that accurate

2369
03:25:00,543 --> 03:25:02,335
But I think it is

2370
03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:09,503
One thing I did want to mention is that a while ago when I did the the the pulse codes to Black X

2371
03:25:09,759 --> 03:25:14,111
Am I did spend a little bit of effort trying to figure out the math to

2372
03:25:14,367 --> 03:25:18,207
To getting the the time codes divided right

2373
03:25:18,463 --> 03:25:22,815
So the offset from and the the DePaul time

2374
03:25:23,071 --> 03:25:29,215
I'm trying to get them so it was actually like the center of the the hit not the edge

2375
03:25:29,471 --> 03:25:35,615
Edgewater back to buy being in the center of the hit it would be Wednesday the single Sweet Thing by

2376
03:25:35,871 --> 03:25:40,223
Until I could be starting here in ending here I'm giving you this time right here in the middle

2377
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:43,807
By doing that it means that

2378
03:25:44,063 --> 03:25:46,367
Won't be like

2379
03:25:46,623 --> 03:25:50,207
Oh yeah to a certain amount and yeah it'll just be like no it's

2380
03:25:50,463 --> 03:25:55,071
Rye tell you the times now it's it should I'm sure I'm a little bit wrong too

2381
03:25:55,327 --> 03:25:57,631
Katalin Street

2382
03:25:57,887 --> 03:26:04,031
Yeah it's Alan here is thinking that we are going to need to worry about I think all those small differences

2383
03:26:04,287 --> 03:26:06,847
But I think for our purposes

2384
03:26:07,103 --> 03:26:08,895
Of the final

2385
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:15,551
Projects or projects here since we are going to make it super lightweight worrying about that kind of Eric Russians good

2386
03:26:15,807 --> 03:26:17,087
How to make it heavier right

2387
03:26:17,599 --> 03:26:23,743
And so if we just say this. Is good enough for our purposes

2388
03:26:23,999 --> 03:26:28,863
I think one of the biggest things I'm going to have to focus on here is is lightning

2389
03:26:29,887 --> 03:26:36,031
Getting this off the ground in awful is way more important to me than making it good so

2390
03:26:36,287 --> 03:26:42,431
It doesn't have to track read it's just got to work kind of and then hopefully other people are going to

2391
03:26:42,687 --> 03:26:47,295
Maybe even need willing to go back and try to actually fix this and do the parts the right way

2392
03:26:47,551 --> 03:26:50,879
I'm trying to get more of a framework out of this as soon as possible

2393
03:26:51,135 --> 03:26:53,439
Rather than the every single detail

2394
03:26:53,951 --> 03:26:55,231
Exactly Shogun

2395
03:26:57,279 --> 03:27:03,423
Powell yeah I really think was we get enough data we can just kind of normalize a lot of it

2396
03:27:03,679 --> 03:27:07,007
I mean there might be inaccuracies but I don't know

2397
03:27:08,287 --> 03:27:10,335
Isn't divided code open source

2398
03:27:13,663 --> 03:27:15,455
Is the Viper code open source

2399
03:27:15,711 --> 03:27:19,807
There's 50 sosv Vive Libre that's open source

2400
03:27:20,575 --> 03:27:21,599
But

2401
03:27:22,623 --> 03:27:28,767
Actually it's interesting you know you guys we might want to just copy off of some of what the Osos VR Vive Libre people

2402
03:27:29,023 --> 03:27:29,535
You are doing

2403
03:27:29,791 --> 03:27:31,071
But I

2404
03:27:31,839 --> 03:27:37,983
Alan says you can get it roughly working with approximation approximately working

2405
03:27:38,239 --> 03:27:42,591
The osr Vive open the website

2406
03:27:42,847 --> 03:27:48,991
Svr

2407
03:27:49,247 --> 03:27:51,295
Right now we don't want to be good right now

2408
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:56,415
As

2409
03:27:56,671 --> 03:27:58,207
Is we'll always points out

2410
03:27:58,463 --> 03:28:03,839
There's a thing that's a thousand times better than good code and its functional code

2411
03:28:04,351 --> 03:28:08,191
I don't know maybe there is a S5 control

2412
03:28:08,447 --> 03:28:14,591
Alan says they're just wrapping openvr beliefs no I think that's most VR

2413
03:28:14,847 --> 03:28:18,943
Survive is rapping openvr

2414
03:28:19,199 --> 03:28:25,343
But I think that osvr Vive Libre is actually trying to read the data straight from the 80s

2415
03:28:25,599 --> 03:28:26,879
Straight from the vibe

2416
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:28,927
Cell

2417
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:36,095
Lie cuz iOS VR Vive Libras actually doing things with like live USB and connecting to it and I kind of got

2418
03:28:36,351 --> 03:28:42,239
A lot of the info that we used to open up the connection how to do all that from osvr Vive Libre

2419
03:28:46,847 --> 03:28:52,991
Oh yeah currently they are only actually doing I am you tracking but they have a lot of stuff in here

2420
03:28:53,247 --> 03:28:57,343
That I don't understand because there's entirely too many lines of code

2421
03:28:59,135 --> 03:29:00,159
And I just I just

2422
03:29:00,415 --> 03:29:02,975
When it's when I start seeing like structures of

2423
03:29:03,231 --> 03:29:05,791
Auto sample pointer

2424
03:29:06,303 --> 03:29:11,679
Stuff that's in headers and yeah I'm not a C+ plus programmer anymore

2425
03:29:12,447 --> 03:29:15,263
There was a time but that that's long ago

2426
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:20,383
I've never used the Tuple in my life

2427
03:29:20,895 --> 03:29:22,943
I kind of have an idea as to what it means

2428
03:29:23,711 --> 03:29:24,223
But

2429
03:29:25,503 --> 03:29:27,295
I guess I do know what it means but

2430
03:29:28,063 --> 03:29:28,575
Yeah

2431
03:29:29,087 --> 03:29:30,111
I'm not going to

2432
03:29:30,367 --> 03:29:31,135
Dig through this

2433
03:29:37,791 --> 03:29:42,911
This project is not intended to like make boatloads of money for the next big theme thing

2434
03:29:44,959 --> 03:29:45,727
Could we

2435
03:29:45,983 --> 03:29:46,495
Please

2436
03:29:47,007 --> 03:29:50,335
I mean like any money

2437
03:29:50,847 --> 03:29:56,991
Let's try to like make the the the funky Hardware that we want to make first

2438
03:29:58,527 --> 03:29:59,039
Yeah

2439
03:30:00,319 --> 03:30:01,343
Wrap it up

2440
03:30:11,583 --> 03:30:13,119
Encryption

2441
03:30:15,167 --> 03:30:21,311
Fgb hrl says this sort of stuff it's just strange situation talking

2442
03:30:21,567 --> 03:30:27,711
Allen is this stuff nd8 I mean I take it bailed doesn't care that much if this is opened up right

2443
03:30:27,967 --> 03:30:30,271
I'm assuming you would have encrypted this channel otherwise

2444
03:30:30,527 --> 03:30:36,159
I would love to hear a statement from from Allan or bad on this

2445
03:30:36,671 --> 03:30:42,815
But I'm I'm so appreciative that they're willing to play ball with you know somebody just wanting to have fun with this and mess around

2446
03:30:51,263 --> 03:30:53,311
Wait one minute

2447
03:30:55,103 --> 03:30:57,151
Latency of the stream is really good

2448
03:30:57,407 --> 03:30:57,919
How

2449
03:30:58,687 --> 03:31:04,831
In one box that I'm unaware of I'm not under any nda's at all with valve

2450
03:31:05,087 --> 03:31:08,671
Or or HTC or anything like that so

2451
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:13,023
I don't think this is a problem

2452
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:20,447
Alan says quote

2453
03:31:20,703 --> 03:31:23,263
What you are doing is fine by me

2454
03:31:25,823 --> 03:31:30,943
I'm going to copy and paste that out

2455
03:31:33,247 --> 03:31:37,855
No no actually would be in the Stream are you can write the time in the Stream that it was

2456
03:31:38,111 --> 03:31:44,255
What is the stream say TimeWise for you guys like look at it I think it says that for every 1440

2457
03:31:44,511 --> 03:31:48,351
Can somebody else right in the fish at what time the stream is at for you guys

2458
03:31:48,607 --> 03:31:54,751
Its 4:48 but we started recording and stopped recording and started recording it stopped recording so I don't know

2459
03:31:55,007 --> 03:31:56,799
It kept that the whole while

2460
03:31:57,055 --> 03:31:58,847
I'm pretty sure that's what it actually is

2461
03:32:00,127 --> 03:32:01,663
Live Oak

2462
03:32:15,487 --> 03:32:19,071
Okay don't worry about it when it gets all edited for Life release

2463
03:32:22,655 --> 03:32:25,727
Oh my God

2464
03:32:26,495 --> 03:32:27,775
Maybe it's that means

2465
03:32:28,287 --> 03:32:29,567
They just capitalizing doesn't work

2466
03:32:30,079 --> 03:32:31,359
I don't know

2467
03:32:32,639 --> 03:32:36,991
I don't think it's good it's not doing what you're doing and then I

2468
03:32:38,783 --> 03:32:42,367
Tried to do something else put user in timeout

2469
03:32:42,623 --> 03:32:46,463
Okay so there's no way to actually know sometime

2470
03:32:46,975 --> 03:32:47,487
Okay

2471
03:32:53,375 --> 03:32:55,935
Restring 45 hours last time

2472
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:59,775
Yeah also one of the thing I think that is

2473
03:33:00,031 --> 03:33:06,175
I don't know if a lot of people are going to go out and buy Vibes because of the stream and this particular project but I'd like to believe that

2474
03:33:06,431 --> 03:33:11,551
By the end of this there's going to be a couple people who got fives that wouldn't have gotten them otherwise

2475
03:33:17,951 --> 03:33:21,279
Okay I think we're just we're done right let's just

2476
03:33:21,535 --> 03:33:27,679
Close up shop anything anybody have anything else specific to this project please take a

2477
03:33:27,935 --> 03:33:34,079
Discussion in issue number 3 on the

2478
03:33:34,335 --> 03:33:36,127
Live survive

2479
03:33:36,383 --> 03:33:42,527
Issue Number 3 is where we will discuss reading in this tracking data and trying to resolve the position

2480
03:33:42,783 --> 03:33:45,599
Of the lighthouse and orientation of the lighthouse

2481
03:33:48,671 --> 03:33:51,999
Relative to the HMV being in 00

2482
03:33:52,255 --> 03:33:53,023
0

2483
03:33:53,535 --> 03:33:59,679
And determine the lighthouse position cuz after that we can determine the lighthouse position

2484
03:33:59,935 --> 03:34:00,447
It's

2485
03:34:00,703 --> 03:34:06,079
Hard but it's the next epiphora we can actually start tracking things with the lighthouses

2486
03:34:08,383 --> 03:34:10,175
Hey Alban

2487
03:34:10,431 --> 03:34:12,223
Awesome get the Vive

2488
03:34:12,479 --> 03:34:16,575
Frank Russell darkness and potentially

2489
03:34:17,343 --> 03:34:23,231
Okay so looks like valve is selling some Vibes because of this awesome attitude that they're taking towards this

2490
03:34:23,743 --> 03:34:25,023
I'm sure more than a few

2491
03:34:25,791 --> 03:34:27,071
Not just here but everywhere

2492
03:34:34,239 --> 03:34:39,359
Yes we get IDs for each sensor position data without hmd being connected

2493
03:34:39,615 --> 03:34:45,759
So my my end goal that I'm not going to be very specific

2494
03:34:46,015 --> 03:34:52,159
About would require while I wouldn't require but it would be really convenient if I could get the

2495
03:34:52,415 --> 03:34:55,487
Mission data from my own things

2496
03:34:57,023 --> 03:35:03,167
Without the without the agency being connected so I'm really hoping that that that's a feature

2497
03:35:03,423 --> 03:35:04,447
That stays

2498
03:35:04,703 --> 03:35:08,543
I should wait no can if I turn off the hmd will that

2499
03:35:13,919 --> 03:35:17,247
It does but what if I build my own Hardware

2500
03:35:19,295 --> 03:35:22,879
Looks like the lighthouses still blinking blinking

2501
03:35:23,647 --> 03:35:26,975
I can see the little laser is doing their laser thing

2502
03:35:35,679 --> 03:35:41,823
Ben do you really believe that the work we've done on the wireless controller is that bad

2503
03:35:55,391 --> 03:35:56,671
Water diet

2504
03:35:56,927 --> 03:36:01,791
Knowing has been dead the water has not run

2505
03:36:02,047 --> 03:36:03,839
Cuz we're managing this Charles

2506
03:36:15,871 --> 03:36:16,639
Yes it's just

2507
03:36:18,431 --> 03:36:19,967
Having a hard time

2508
03:36:20,479 --> 03:36:24,063
Generating pressure so it's not staying on because that switches horrible

2509
03:36:27,647 --> 03:36:30,207
Although to be fair but did stay out of my burn out the motor so

2510
03:36:30,463 --> 03:36:31,231
Maybe.

2511
03:36:39,935 --> 03:36:43,007
So if I understand correctly it still impractical.

2512
03:36:43,519 --> 03:36:46,591
Program the lasers to always attempted blind to the user

2513
03:36:47,103 --> 03:36:48,127
Class

2514
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:49,663
Fast to lasers

2515
03:36:56,831 --> 03:37:02,719
Just throw in the lasers to attempt a blind that users like a hardware thing you'd be able to produce something

2516
03:37:09,887 --> 03:37:16,031
Check to make sure the toilet is not like leaking leaking like

2517
03:37:16,287 --> 03:37:22,431
Alright alright

2518
03:37:28,063 --> 03:37:34,207
Would like to use lighthouses in for tracking arbitrary objects idealia and I have both setup go to real-world site

2519
03:37:36,767 --> 03:37:39,071
Can you just turn off the toilet right now

2520
03:37:40,351 --> 03:37:42,143
Pop-up to lighthouses in Saipan

2521
03:37:43,679 --> 03:37:46,751
Why do bats what we're getting into it's Angelique routine

2522
03:37:58,783 --> 03:38:00,063
Running continuously

2523
03:38:00,319 --> 03:38:02,367
Killing the water then

2524
03:38:02,879 --> 03:38:09,023
When you replace the toilet did you replace the flushing mechanism as well or did you

2525
03:38:09,279 --> 03:38:14,143
Use the same mechanism for the ancient toilet cuz it looks pretty ancient inside there

2526
03:38:18,751 --> 03:38:24,895
Why are we doing what

2527
03:38:25,151 --> 03:38:31,295
If the shut-off valve I can lift up on the shut-off valve as hard as I want it does not show

2528
03:38:31,551 --> 03:38:37,695
Shut off that's not good okay s means we just need to keep turning off the toilet and today you need to manually turn

2529
03:38:44,351 --> 03:38:50,239
Actually you know your dad has like five different toilet pieces down the thumb instead

2530
03:38:50,495 --> 03:38:51,519
I'll wait

2531
03:38:51,775 --> 03:38:57,919
I have a story for everyone

2532
03:38:58,175 --> 03:39:04,319
Oh my gosh guys what is happening right now

2533
03:39:04,575 --> 03:39:10,719
Done with the silliness so

2534
03:39:10,975 --> 03:39:15,071
Are you doing oh we're done with the coding yes let's see you can handle this

2535
03:39:15,583 --> 03:39:21,727
Because we're getting so guys we used to come to my parent's cabin to play rock band and we have a projector

2536
03:39:21,983 --> 03:39:22,495
You're up there

2537
03:39:22,751 --> 03:39:24,799
Andrea project onto this wall over here

2538
03:39:25,055 --> 03:39:30,175
And we would just play Rock Band like all weekend long and one time

2539
03:39:30,431 --> 03:39:32,223
We forgot the drum pedal

2540
03:39:32,735 --> 03:39:34,015
Oh and

2541
03:39:34,271 --> 03:39:35,039
Now get this

2542
03:39:35,295 --> 03:39:41,439
I was like oh no we can't play Rock Band cuz there's no drum pedal I go to the shed downstairs and sitting on a Shelf

2543
03:39:41,695 --> 03:39:46,559
Is this there is not not this I put this together there is a spring

2544
03:39:46,815 --> 03:39:52,959
In in the Shelf there was on the Shelf there was the spring the washers the screws funny little

2545
03:39:53,215 --> 03:39:59,359
Metal plate thing and this copper wire and a hinge it was sitting all on a shelf to go

2546
03:39:59,615 --> 03:40:03,455
Together in the last person that was there was my grandfather before he died

2547
03:40:03,711 --> 03:40:05,503
So my grandfather

2548
03:40:05,759 --> 03:40:11,903
Like more than 5 years previous to put all of these things on a shelf all together for me to make this

2549
03:40:12,159 --> 03:40:15,231
Rock band pedal so we can play rock band at the cabin

2550
03:40:15,743 --> 03:40:16,255
So

2551
03:40:16,511 --> 03:40:19,327
I don't know I just thought that was a pretty cool story

2552
03:40:21,887 --> 03:40:27,007
It was meant to be yeah yeah it was you wanted to do guitar didn't you

2553
03:40:28,031 --> 03:40:28,543
Guitar

2554
03:40:29,311 --> 03:40:35,455
Guitar string broke

2555
03:40:35,711 --> 03:40:38,783
Baltimore Maryland

2556
03:40:41,087 --> 03:40:45,951
ESP 8622 nobody's supposed to know about the 8622 yet

2557
03:40:51,583 --> 03:40:57,727
Hey maybe next time we do like our along streams we can have like Charles commercial breaks where we do like a little music break

2558
03:40:58,239 --> 03:41:01,055
Well I wanted to have Max play the guitar but

2559
03:41:05,151 --> 03:41:06,687
I'm working on I have original stuff

2560
03:41:06,943 --> 03:41:08,223
No

2561
03:41:08,479 --> 03:41:14,623
Okay. Or like a public domain so like that one

2562
03:41:14,879 --> 03:41:16,159
One more thing

2563
03:41:17,439 --> 03:41:21,535
Strata

2564
03:41:24,607 --> 03:41:30,751
Probably the only person who's actually giving me any money or material resources is Unity Technologies

2565
03:41:35,359 --> 03:41:41,503
My secret source for the USPS I can't tell you where my secret

2566
03:41:41,759 --> 03:41:45,343
Source to get all of my esps is I'm really sorry

2567
03:41:46,879 --> 03:41:49,439
Lighthouse tracked guitars that would be pretty cool

2568
03:41:49,695 --> 03:41:54,559
But that's not the idea that I was going after I'll tell you that it's not what I what my angle is

2569
03:41:55,071 --> 03:41:57,119
That would be okay

2570
03:41:57,631 --> 03:42:03,775
Could you imagine actually seeing the drum set and the drumsticks while you're doing it in VR

2571
03:42:08,127 --> 03:42:12,735
Okay I guess I wasn't as cool as I thought it was

2572
03:42:12,991 --> 03:42:16,831
Emma I might even see something you're saying some some piece

2573
03:42:20,671 --> 03:42:22,719
Nope not doing enough PJ won't touch it

2574
03:42:26,559 --> 03:42:32,703
Sorry John John Moriarty also works for Unity Technologies and no we did not bring the cool

2575
03:42:32,959 --> 03:42:35,007
Find the cabinet might have gotten damaged

2576
03:42:35,263 --> 03:42:41,407
We see if I can pull

2577
03:42:41,663 --> 03:42:44,479
A picture of those the cool sign

2578
03:42:44,735 --> 03:42:50,879
I know the girls will be so much fun with it rock band t r i know right that's what I care about

2579
03:42:51,135 --> 03:42:55,743
Mickens and unity Unity 3D

2580
03:42:56,255 --> 03:43:02,399
People open Facebook here

2581
03:43:02,655 --> 03:43:05,727
Oh did I already do it

2582
03:43:07,263 --> 03:43:09,311
NPR

2583
03:43:12,383 --> 03:43:16,991
IMAX

2584
03:43:17,247 --> 03:43:20,575
Can you check on Monday I'm going to pull up the

2585
03:43:20,831 --> 03:43:26,975
Bathroom bathroom

2586
03:43:27,231 --> 03:43:31,327
Give me a second here oh boy there's a lot of people talking

2587
03:43:37,471 --> 03:43:41,567
Music pr project o

2588
03:43:43,871 --> 03:43:47,199
Music VR project

2589
03:43:47,967 --> 03:43:50,015
It's a concert stuff

2590
03:43:57,439 --> 03:44:01,535
Manistee literally was drunk thing I don't you try it I'll be fine I'd love to do that

2591
03:44:02,559 --> 03:44:06,143
How do I reattach the

2592
03:44:09,215 --> 03:44:10,495
Would you guys want like

2593
03:44:10,751 --> 03:44:16,127
A retiring on air drumming or would you want like actual physical 6 in your hand and you like

2594
03:44:16,639 --> 03:44:22,527
Hit the air like I'm a rock bands like if it's very physical like experience I don't really know how this VR thing would work out

2595
03:44:24,575 --> 03:44:26,367
Aerodrums

2596
03:44:26,623 --> 03:44:32,767
Might my actual goal isn't showing the picture

2597
03:44:33,023 --> 03:44:36,863
You definitely cheats on how to use a finger rolls instead of

2598
03:44:37,375 --> 03:44:38,399
Rely on the pod

2599
03:44:39,167 --> 03:44:41,983
Where is I'm trying to find another picture of the sign

2600
03:44:43,263 --> 03:44:49,407
Drums without a story passed the interesting bits

2601
03:44:49,663 --> 03:44:55,807
90s

2602
03:44:57,855 --> 03:44:58,623
Attacks

2603
03:44:59,647 --> 03:45:02,463
Attach 625 controllers with tape

2604
03:45:02,719 --> 03:45:08,863
Oh I know no that's terrible that's why I'm trying to solve this

2605
03:45:09,119 --> 03:45:11,423
Controllers

2606
03:45:11,935 --> 03:45:15,263
Actually just email

2607
03:45:15,519 --> 03:45:21,663
My degree in computer engineering I am kind of qualified to be a PGA Pro

2608
03:45:21,919 --> 03:45:28,063
Programmer and do vlsi work however I absolutely hate it so

2609
03:45:30,111 --> 03:45:36,255
I have definitely done a lot of verilogue in school I have not done a line of verilogue since I don't intend to change that

2610
03:45:51,871 --> 03:45:58,015
Jermaine requires haptics to be done properly which is probably super obvious

2611
03:45:58,527 --> 03:46:00,063
No I don't

2612
03:46:00,319 --> 03:46:06,463
Things like rolling are impossible Buzz rolling is impossible without a tie open rolls are one hundred percent possible without it though

2613
03:46:06,719 --> 03:46:12,863
Because you use like your fingers here in order to feel like control an open roll

2614
03:46:18,495 --> 03:46:23,103
They're on the floor behind the finger yacht call and get them

2615
03:46:23,615 --> 03:46:27,455
Down behind the

2616
03:46:27,711 --> 03:46:33,855
Nope there

2617
03:46:34,111 --> 03:46:35,647
Stick with sensors

2618
03:46:36,159 --> 03:46:39,743
And you could put haptic feedback if you wanted it but

2619
03:46:41,535 --> 03:46:45,887
Yeah I like tactile feedback it's what makes them so enjoyable but

2620
03:46:48,959 --> 03:46:52,543
You could do most all of it except for Buzz stuff

2621
03:46:55,871 --> 03:47:01,247
I guess trying to express like the different types of runs like sandstedt clicks would be kind of hard to

2622
03:47:26,847 --> 03:47:32,991
Perfect oh no

2623
03:47:33,247 --> 03:47:36,831
Hindi points. CSV. Zip did not go

2624
03:47:37,343 --> 03:47:42,207
Please Charles watch one minute we don't really have a lot of bandwidth to spare otherwise I totally blow it up

2625
03:47:42,719 --> 03:47:48,863
Pull what up their drums video I really rather not

2626
03:47:49,119 --> 03:47:55,263
Right now streaming

2627
03:47:56,799 --> 03:48:01,919
Your mother's dead pretty much

2628
03:48:17,791 --> 03:48:23,935
Also just might be like entirely different types of instruments you might be able to even make this br.

2629
03:48:24,191 --> 03:48:30,335
Imagine what theremin hero is going to do when this gets to him

2630
03:48:30,591 --> 03:48:33,663
Don't you guys haven't seen theremin Heroes Channel at the pretty cool Channel

2631
03:48:33,919 --> 03:48:40,063
But so as far as Air Jordans go for what I know I don't know

2632
03:48:40,319 --> 03:48:41,599
Ceragem sing it

2633
03:48:41,855 --> 03:48:43,903
But there's a

2634
03:48:44,159 --> 03:48:45,183
Was the camera here

2635
03:48:45,439 --> 03:48:51,583
There's a rolling to relight can you use this this part of your fingers to like make it bounce

2636
03:48:51,839 --> 03:48:57,983
You going to go really really fast but like I don't even have a

2637
03:48:58,239 --> 03:49:03,871
Service here to be able to create that noise you can't do that without the hafter without

2638
03:49:04,383 --> 03:49:10,527
A bouncy rubber rubber surface or a sneer service or something but

2639
03:49:11,039 --> 03:49:13,343
And open role is totally possible

2640
03:49:14,111 --> 03:49:15,903
Without a surface

2641
03:49:32,543 --> 03:49:35,103
Why can I no longer get the points data

2642
03:49:36,639 --> 03:49:40,223
You guys see anything wrong here

2643
03:49:56,095 --> 03:49:58,655
I did a lot of drama in high school

2644
03:50:00,191 --> 03:50:02,239
It was a lot of fun

2645
03:50:07,615 --> 03:50:10,175
What's going on why can I not why is it not happening

2646
03:50:11,711 --> 03:50:12,991
Oh my gosh

2647
03:50:13,503 --> 03:50:16,831
What is up with this there should be model points in there

2648
03:50:25,279 --> 03:50:27,839
Lighthouses still one?

2649
03:50:28,095 --> 03:50:34,239
No no the lineup shouldn't matter I'm just trying to pull the config again because I realized I didn't upload the HMV points

2650
03:50:35,519 --> 03:50:41,663
He blew it again I did not just blow away the config again I just did not but I did not do it we

2651
03:50:41,919 --> 03:50:48,063
We have a backup config that we've been using we can use that but I want to know why it's not reading it

2652
03:50:48,319 --> 03:50:52,927
Why is it not reading the config

2653
03:50:53,439 --> 03:50:59,583
My man Catonsville high school required a lot a lot a lot of pot paradiddles between snare drum and cowbell sound awesome

2654
03:51:17,247 --> 03:51:18,271
Quick recap

2655
03:51:20,575 --> 03:51:26,719
I think we're going to be done soon so we can do the recap as we're wrapping up well right now I realized I forgot to

2656
03:51:26,975 --> 03:51:31,583
Include a bunch of the whatever the this file that didn't upload

2657
03:51:31,839 --> 03:51:32,607
Right here

2658
03:51:34,399 --> 03:51:39,007
Battle that apparently I didn't upload and I apparently deleted or something

2659
03:51:41,055 --> 03:51:47,199
And for some reason I can't seem to get it anymore

2660
03:51:47,455 --> 03:51:48,735
I'm not sure why

2661
03:51:57,951 --> 03:51:59,999
A reasonably large marshmallows anyone

2662
03:52:03,327 --> 03:52:05,375
I could not fit know

2663
03:52:05,887 --> 03:52:08,447
No show the camera

2664
03:52:09,471 --> 03:52:12,031
We have giant marshmallows

2665
03:52:16,895 --> 03:52:20,223
Okay that's enough

2666
03:52:22,527 --> 03:52:28,671
Why am I not able to get those hey wait nope

2667
03:52:28,927 --> 03:52:30,207
I am I not able to get the data

2668
03:52:31,231 --> 03:52:33,279
What is going on

2669
03:53:01,951 --> 03:53:04,767
No the data still there

2670
03:53:05,535 --> 03:53:07,583
Model points is still a thing

2671
03:53:08,607 --> 03:53:10,399
Why am I not able to read it

2672
03:53:11,423 --> 03:53:12,959
What is going on

2673
03:53:15,007 --> 03:53:16,543
Why is this broken

2674
03:53:27,039 --> 03:53:29,343
61 of them what's wrong

2675
03:53:50,847 --> 03:53:55,967
Is VR Minecraft the same Oculus Rift

2676
03:53:57,503 --> 03:54:02,367
Adam do you know is is VR Minecraft the thing

2677
03:54:03,135 --> 03:54:07,231
Yes VR Minecraft is a thing I've not yet figured out how to actually get it working

2678
03:54:07,487 --> 03:54:13,631
Adam said he could not figure out how to get it working oh my gosh that's a lot of errors

2679
03:54:13,887 --> 03:54:17,471
Oh that makes sense cuz you know it's their thing

2680
03:54:24,383 --> 03:54:30,527
Hololens is not VR

2681
03:54:56,639 --> 03:55:02,783
I'm actually navion AR stuff for hololens more than anything but it's expensive

2682
03:55:07,647 --> 03:55:13,791
I was even in line to get one I like applied for the developer one whenever it was so close and they're like how you can get one and then I saw

2683
03:55:14,047 --> 03:55:15,583
The person I was like no I can't

2684
03:56:14,463 --> 03:56:16,511
Are people actually watchmecode

2685
03:56:16,767 --> 03:56:22,911
Five craft

2686
03:56:23,167 --> 03:56:25,727
In the Stream

2687
03:56:26,495 --> 03:56:27,263
No

2688
03:56:31,359 --> 03:56:32,895
The only way I can get my pool

2689
03:56:33,151 --> 03:56:34,431
That laptop

2690
03:56:38,527 --> 03:56:40,575
You can scroll up

2691
03:56:40,831 --> 03:56:41,599
Are over

2692
03:56:43,135 --> 03:56:49,279
Are you guys okay

2693
03:56:49,535 --> 03:56:54,143
Trying to figure out how I messed this up

2694
03:56:54,911 --> 03:57:01,055
People wearing Google Glass around like I always tried to Google Glass and it was just it's not

2695
03:57:05,151 --> 03:57:07,199
Robust

2696
03:57:08,223 --> 03:57:12,063
Like he was kind of cool but it was more I feel like gimmicky I'll 57 people

2697
03:57:14,111 --> 03:57:16,415
Gas with bottled water

2698
03:57:42,527 --> 03:57:46,367
Model point it's right there why can't you find a computer

2699
03:57:52,255 --> 03:57:53,791
Don't want to attract new

2700
03:57:55,839 --> 03:57:58,143
Why can't I find it

2701
03:58:01,727 --> 03:58:07,359
Hydrocat says Charles GTB won't make it?

2702
03:58:07,871 --> 03:58:11,711
I don't know I just it's easier for me to run valgrind real quick

2703
03:58:12,991 --> 03:58:19,135
Like I can run it and kill it running kill it running killer wears dccu access to typing like quit it's an extra step

2704
03:58:19,391 --> 03:58:25,535
Little annoyed right now understand

2705
03:58:25,791 --> 03:58:26,815
Hi

2706
03:58:27,071 --> 03:58:28,351
What is wrong

2707
03:58:29,119 --> 03:58:35,263
You're the Oculus just got controllers again we got them at the house that I'm living in right now and

2708
03:58:37,055 --> 03:58:39,103
It was a good experience

2709
03:58:50,623 --> 03:58:51,903
I'm going to put that one back

2710
03:58:52,671 --> 03:58:55,487
What does CLR mean I don't know

2711
03:58:55,743 --> 03:58:57,279
How much are cool people knowing

2712
03:58:58,559 --> 03:59:00,351
Point of my username

2713
03:59:00,607 --> 03:59:04,191
Oh it's just my first name or first initial middle initial last name

2714
03:59:07,007 --> 03:59:13,151
Yeah I was like I don't know how much you're comfortable saying whatever its initial

2715
03:59:13,407 --> 03:59:14,687
Yeah

2716
03:59:15,455 --> 03:59:20,575
Yeah Charles and I don't know Anna is lore nobody knows

2717
03:59:20,831 --> 03:59:21,855
Maybe that's what it is

2718
03:59:22,623 --> 03:59:24,415
Nobody

2719
03:59:25,951 --> 03:59:26,975
Charles nobody lure

2720
03:59:30,815 --> 03:59:34,143
Why isn't this code working I don't know what it is

2721
03:59:35,679 --> 03:59:37,471
I can't even think of it in name

2722
03:59:37,983 --> 03:59:38,495
Ned

2723
03:59:39,775 --> 03:59:40,799
It is not mad

2724
03:59:41,823 --> 03:59:47,967
You only get one choice or 11 guess

2725
03:59:48,223 --> 03:59:54,367
People in chat when ask they can ask Adam. Adam

2726
03:59:54,623 --> 03:59:58,975
Question in his Adams question was Nathan it's not Nathan

2727
04:00:00,767 --> 04:00:02,303
No it's not Noah

2728
04:00:03,839 --> 04:00:04,351
Nick

2729
04:00:04,607 --> 04:00:05,375
Norbert

2730
04:00:05,631 --> 04:00:07,167
It is not Nick

2731
04:00:11,519 --> 04:00:13,311
Barry said no to Nathaniel I think

2732
04:00:13,823 --> 04:00:16,383
I assume Nathan Nathaniel be the same thing

2733
04:00:17,407 --> 04:00:22,527
Homer J Simpson is just in like 10 or something

2734
04:00:22,783 --> 04:00:26,623
Nolan no

2735
04:00:28,927 --> 04:00:29,951
Angie

2736
04:00:31,999 --> 04:00:38,143
Which 57 guess

2737
04:00:39,167 --> 04:00:40,959
Snake necklace Arsenio

2738
04:00:41,727 --> 04:00:44,287
It's not Nick

2739
04:00:45,055 --> 04:00:50,687
I don't give away your necklace guys

2740
04:01:02,719 --> 04:01:06,303
Norm's though it's not a normal

2741
04:01:06,559 --> 04:01:08,095
It's not Nigel

2742
04:01:14,751 --> 04:01:16,543
Nicholas it's not Norman

2743
04:01:17,311 --> 04:01:18,591
It is Nicholas

2744
04:01:24,479 --> 04:01:29,343
Why is my Json EQ failing

2745
04:01:37,791 --> 04:01:39,839
Lancer

2746
04:01:40,095 --> 04:01:43,423
Positioning system was based on huge magnet somehow

2747
04:01:44,447 --> 04:01:48,031
Oh that's cool like a stem system

2748
04:01:48,287 --> 04:01:54,431
Also there is a really cool way that you can also do positioning called stem I don't actually know what it means but what it does

2749
04:01:54,687 --> 04:02:00,831
Is it uses magnetic fields in a Polarises at this way than this way than this way than this way than this way in this way

2750
04:02:01,087 --> 04:02:07,231
By looking at the dude like having a thing in 3D space and looking at the change of the magnetic flux as you change the magnetic flux

2751
04:02:07,487 --> 04:02:11,327
In 3D space it can tell where it is really neat

2752
04:02:11,583 --> 04:02:13,887
But not anywhere near as needed this Lighthouse stuff

2753
04:02:27,967 --> 04:02:33,087
I love you let me figure out why this isn't working first and then I'll log off

2754
04:02:34,879 --> 04:02:41,023
Wait are you back to work and no I something's I accident I don't know what I did with the duddy

2755
04:02:41,279 --> 04:02:47,423
Modify I deleted the file to get help with all the points in it

2756
04:02:47,679 --> 04:02:49,727
And I tried using I realized I didn't have it

2757
04:02:49,983 --> 04:02:54,079
And then it didn't appear to get abs without nobody has the hmd points file

2758
04:02:54,335 --> 04:03:00,479
And means that my other way I'm parsing all this is broken and I got to figure out why that is Princess call or the

2759
04:03:00,735 --> 04:03:05,855
Json eqbgl2q is not returning zero when it should

2760
04:03:06,879 --> 04:03:08,671
Like this here totally

2761
04:03:08,927 --> 04:03:10,463
Wait I + 1

2762
04:03:12,767 --> 04:03:13,791
Call a John

2763
04:03:19,679 --> 04:03:20,447
John

2764
04:03:33,247 --> 04:03:36,831
Residents wouldn't have anywhere near that area

2765
04:03:37,087 --> 04:03:43,231
There is actually a device made by razor

2766
04:03:44,255 --> 04:03:45,791
The Sixth Sense Hydra

2767
04:03:46,047 --> 04:03:52,191
Yeah the Sixth Sense Hydra that actually used magnetometers and a law

2768
04:03:52,447 --> 04:03:56,543
Large ball that created changes in magnetic flux

2769
04:03:58,591 --> 04:04:01,407
The one that I bought on eBay with brick

2770
04:04:07,295 --> 04:04:10,879
0 returned zero

2771
04:04:11,391 --> 04:04:12,927
That's right

2772
04:04:28,799 --> 04:04:30,847
Got Carol what did you download

2773
04:04:58,751 --> 04:05:03,615
Michael says that it wasn't even razors thing six senses separate company that made it

2774
04:05:50,207 --> 04:05:51,999
I should say you should start

2775
04:05:52,255 --> 04:05:53,791
Type defining your function

2776
04:05:56,607 --> 04:06:01,471
Where where is there a problem with the type to improperly type to find function pointer

2777
04:06:05,567 --> 04:06:11,455
John says they downloaded initial hmb data. Text that yours Charles

2778
04:06:11,711 --> 04:06:14,015
They download it from you

2779
04:06:15,039 --> 04:06:21,183
We've been doing this for a while Matthew Jones yeah that would be me but that would be

2780
04:06:21,439 --> 04:06:22,975
The old data

2781
04:06:28,607 --> 04:06:31,679
Let me delete this cuz this is wrong

2782
04:06:43,967 --> 04:06:46,783
California Matthew Jones City find the

2783
04:07:22,367 --> 04:07:23,903
Pretty good to me

2784
04:07:37,727 --> 04:07:41,567
The stream is about collecting data

2785
04:07:41,823 --> 04:07:43,871
And I'm just saying that like data

2786
04:07:44,127 --> 04:07:49,759
From From The Towers

2787
04:07:53,343 --> 04:07:55,647
And then rendering that light data in

2788
04:07:56,671 --> 04:08:02,047
Whatever that was that you had going before I don't know what it was on this live

2789
04:08:03,071 --> 04:08:08,191
So before we were trying to collect the data from the headset

2790
04:08:08,447 --> 04:08:12,799
And parse it tell us where the location of all the the sensors were on the helmet

2791
04:08:13,055 --> 04:08:16,895
So now I've actually posted in the channel

2792
04:08:17,151 --> 04:08:20,991
The hmd points and the the new tracking data

2793
04:08:21,759 --> 04:08:26,367
I'm so I'm actually going to work on this problem at the same time as everyone else but

2794
04:08:27,135 --> 04:08:30,207
Just wanted to let you guys

2795
04:08:30,719 --> 04:08:31,999
Have a crack at A2 since

2796
04:08:32,255 --> 04:08:37,375
Chances are you guys are going to able to come up with a better solution than I am because I was known as the math built

2797
04:08:39,167 --> 04:08:40,447
Electron ashes question

2798
04:08:40,703 --> 04:08:46,847
Is the code something that is screwed up in the latest version does it not get backed up on each commit to

2799
04:08:47,103 --> 04:08:53,247
I don't actually know what happened but it works now so I'm not going to worry about it

2800
04:08:53,503 --> 04:08:54,271
?

2801
04:08:58,111 --> 04:08:59,903
Yeah that change that changed

2802
04:09:01,183 --> 04:09:07,327
Yeah that this is a much better organizational just met this

2803
04:09:08,607 --> 04:09:14,751
I don't think the Power Glove used anything worth talking about not even electron not even ultrasonic transducers

2804
04:09:22,943 --> 04:09:27,807
I think one of the problems was I haven't been committing enough

2805
04:09:30,111 --> 04:09:36,255
Which I'm really bad at anyway especially with get I'm really bad at it with gate with some Persian I would like to make a new versions all the time

2806
04:09:36,511 --> 04:09:38,559
Charles isn't nearly committed enough

2807
04:09:41,887 --> 04:09:45,215
Huh

2808
04:09:46,239 --> 04:09:51,103
Okay everything is now in Issue Number 3 and I have the the coat in there so

2809
04:09:58,271 --> 04:10:00,575
I think it's time to go guys

2810
04:10:01,599 --> 04:10:02,623
I'm sorry

2811
04:10:05,439 --> 04:10:07,231
Although by the way

2812
04:10:07,487 --> 04:10:13,631
Trying to make the Power Glove work with the Vive seems like a pretty honorable

2813
04:10:13,887 --> 04:10:20,031
Saying I might I might actually try for that cuz I do have a video where I totally hack the snot out of a

2814
04:10:20,287 --> 04:10:21,311
A Nintendo zapper

2815
04:10:21,567 --> 04:10:25,407
You're curious just look up seeing Laura Nintendo zapper I had a lot of fun with that one

2816
04:10:27,455 --> 04:10:30,015
Congress

2817
04:10:30,271 --> 04:10:30,783
Oh

2818
04:10:32,319 --> 04:10:34,623
Okay goodbye Noah

2819
04:10:35,135 --> 04:10:37,439
Goodbye everyone

2820
04:10:41,535 --> 04:10:43,839
Goodnight bleep Pavel

2821
04:10:45,375 --> 04:10:48,447
The way over there

2822
04:10:49,727 --> 04:10:51,263
Where you're at least going to do it again

2823
04:10:51,519 --> 04:10:52,543
Early at this point

2824
04:10:56,639 --> 04:10:57,919
David Aaron do this again

2825
04:10:58,175 --> 04:11:00,735
We might be doing it

2826
04:11:01,247 --> 04:11:04,575
I mean I don't know weekends whenever I'm free

2827
04:11:04,831 --> 04:11:05,855
Some weekends

2828
04:11:08,415 --> 04:11:10,207
Okay
