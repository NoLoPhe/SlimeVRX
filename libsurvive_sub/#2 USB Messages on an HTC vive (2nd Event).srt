00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello I think I just went you guys can get in the

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Chat tell me if my levels are okay this is about how loud I'm going to be during the broadcast

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
I think I'm set up a little bit better with it today don't know still don't see anybody in the

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Can you guys hear me because it sounds great

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,672
Oh yeah I realize that the levels were pretty low

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Yesterday and so when I got loud he got really loud

7
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,424
So we don't want to do that

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
Just pulling up a little bit of stuff right now getting my screen size

9
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
Set up

10
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Think I just pulled

11
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
Everything's up to date

12
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
K

13
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
That looks good too

14
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
Potestas

15
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Excellent working so it's about time to start the

16
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Video here check the

17
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
Whoa there is

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Is bunch of people in 15 seconds like how do

19
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Do you guys know how much like there is OB cuz of the video to begin with

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Okay so let's start video now

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
I say that because I shall start as like I say that because what I'll do is I'll go back and edit it so the video actually stopped

22
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
Specific intro anyway

23
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
So in a previous video I was hacking the HTC Vive controllers and trying

24
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
How to figure out what the various messages that come from them are now they're very well understood when you plug them in but

25
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
They're not that well understood if they're trying to communicate wirelessly and one of the highlights from last time

26
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
Was that one of the developers of the vibe hopped in and started giving away some tips in

27
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Intrexon stuff like that some of the things that I'm just assuming that he the reason this is so much more

28
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
More complicated is because these things are using Nordic semi chip and bases precious so

29
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
He did a number of really really clever things to try to Pare down the amount of data is being sent back

30
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Unfortunately it means that it's extremely difficult to figure out what he did so

31
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
In the previous video we we got a lot of stuff kind of torn apart and figure it out and if you haven't already

32
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
You probably should really watch the starting

33
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,592
Love it because it kind of shows really what this is all about and I don't want to go into that again

34
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
But I did want to show you guys was so that a VR thing that I had working on here

35
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Now it has three LEDs and I can't earn each one of them on and off individually

36
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
And the they are right now map tint

37
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
Two different holes on the Vive controller so I can turn them on and off individual

38
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
And this is one where I have my environment ready I have everything ready to go but I want to make it more

39
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
So what I'll be doing is I have the the AVR code that I can easily change

40
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:11,392
And that's right here this is all just the AVR code

41
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
That can control lighting up a specific marker and I can have code that'll do this and I

42
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
That can light up two markers at once or all three markers at once and what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to light up

43
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
Combinations of these three markers to figure out what his code actually does and what those funky

44
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
He commands me so I have no problem with opening up a adjust

45
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
GitHub and copying and pasting a bunch of these examples into the jet so you guys can participate in real time

46
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm honestly a little bit more burned out today than I was last time so you guys be great

47
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
Timmy Guy start taking initiative start to really think critically about the packet and and

48
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
How they might be going together so let's just start with first things first

49
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
The just so you guys understand what's in the Stream here actually first

50
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
Brandon are you in chat

51
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
So far you guys who don't know my my roommate inverse phase over there he is acting as

52
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:28,191
Moderator she's actually working on a a python track of a python like chiptunes music

53
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
And it says he is a chiptune artist and he knows python so he's been out here the last couple of days up till 4

54
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
For 5 a.m. working on that tracker anyway moving forward here

55
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
Let's let's actually get into what these different fields mean

56
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
And how about how we learned it so what actually happened

57
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
When's that comes back from the The Watchmen this thing right here is the

58
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Is the messages

59
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
229 B messages it were pretty sure that we figured out exactly how big of that message we care about

60
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
And just Lop off the end additionally we think this is based on some of the things that Ben hits

61
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
Said that the last four B

62
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:32,191
Are the CRC of the on-air checksum so we can probably discard them

63
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Especially considering I think they would be the Searcy of the encoded data

64
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,991
So I'm just going to ignore them for right now the other things that we found out

65
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
Bi-directionally encoded so from the back of the stream going forward you can look at the numbers and

66
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
And they mean different things so the last three B here are the time code of when nothing happened then

67
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
Start reading back this number right here is the length and this case of the pulse time

68
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
And this is the code of which led was was the one that was on so right now I'm only blinking when I leave

69
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
So it's code 48

70
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Yeah we're in the other dc-baltimore area so it is Us East time

71
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
Knoxville to stay up past midnight maybe probably 12:15

72
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,191
Stay off tonight eastern time so that's about 3 and a half hours from now

73
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
Amish I think you should be able to get pretty far 4 hours Brandon

74
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
I'm going to call him Brendan but his name is inverse phase and

75
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
You guys like chiptunes I'm going to ask him to go like paste the link to his YouTube

76
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Moving on does anybody have any questions right now about the data as it stands or should I just keep going into

77
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
To what we found out so far just see what some people think I am expecting

78
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
A little bit more feedback this time how many people are

79
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Find the chat

80
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
Okay that's good it's not

81
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
Not as big but okay so what we know so far is the last for

82
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
Then the next 3 going from the back forward is the is the time

83
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
Encode and then comes this absolutely insane thing that then did what happens if

84
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
Is your going backwards is you look at a number and if the ones place or sorry there's a

85
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
One in the the 128th Place Saudi 1/8 or higher out front

86
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
What happens is you have to read the next fight over to find out what's really going on I'm so in this

87
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Case we have zero X 0481 so I'll just show you guys wouldn't that

88
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
I would really look like so 0 X8 1004

89
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
Number and so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be reading it from going back

90
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
So the way when we would read this as we would first look at

91
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
0x 0 4 and with that indicates is that there'll be another bite

92
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Because it's less

93
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Is less than 128 and so we read the next bite

94
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
But first we do is we shifted over seven places so 200 47

95
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
I can't do that bummer

96
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,791
47 places that's 512 which is

97
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
0 x 200

98
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
What we do is we look at the next fight over so 81 so because

99
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
Is a greater than or equal to

100
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
128 if a terminator and so what that mean

101
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
As we can just order the enemy. So that's your X200 or 0 x 81 equals your X2

102
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
281 and that's the actual value based on some hints from them

103
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
Dan from last time what we know is all of these values that are here these the values that will be after the star

104
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Barcode with by-the-way 48-star the LED codes 48 is the LED code all of these back here

105
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
Are just relative times so what happens is we going to pause this will start at time

106
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
A6 C5 D5 and then

107
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
We know that led number 48 notice they're all divisible by 80 also pointed that out

108
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:21,215
And so it starts at this time

109
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
He is on and it is on for this length of time which is decoded as 0 x 281

110
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
And then it turns off and then that's the end of it so right now all that are actually doing

111
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
And here is we are turning on or linking it to MHz about

112
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,815
Seems to work better if I go like much slower I'm thinking it's around 1.4 MHz I don't know why that works

113
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Better but anyway I turn it on and off a 2.4 megahertz for a bit of time

114
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,615
And then I sleep and so that's how we get this the most basic code

115
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
This is really simple to read now that we know how to do it it does it is a little bit can

116
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
Using cuz the order of things is a little wacky but it

117
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
It it it is totally I won't break the Vive again datum

118
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
It is totally doable I bricked the Vive yesterday and it is

119
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
Bricked permanently sort of I was much earlier in the day was trying

120
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
Find Rudolph the configuration data but I accidentally had the set B set instead of

121
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
Set witch

122
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Which which actually

123
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
Made it wipe out all of the hid data for the configuration for the vibe

124
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
You things just fine I could even read your headset but all of the config data that talk about the gyros in the exact location

125
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Of all of these things was totally blown away which also I found out that

126
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
This is crazy with the who it's all sweaty from me anyway

127
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,487
Nation of all of these sensors is calibrated in the factory Sono to Vive the same and they know that

128
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
And the vibe store their config data I blew away mine somebody on Fox fired

129
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
I think his name was was was really really helpful

130
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
And and and and he was able to give us a copy of his config for similar Vive which after tweak

131
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
Making some values we were able to get going again I can't really tell the tracking difference but

132
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
But everybody online seems to think that this is horrible and that it's going to be terrible

133
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,887
I think I looked out and addition then shot an email to HTC to see if they can actually pull

134
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
A copy of our config from this Vibe as it was shipped which if they do that

135
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Whole thankful back to 100%

136
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
And if not well it looks like I'm going to have to reverse-engineer the rest of all of this mess so that I

137
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
I can go calibrate this at myself

138
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
Oh really

139
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
So Adam this is my roommate he's the vibe

140
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Has he has a plugged into his computer

141
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
By the way if anybody does want to hack your Vibes definitely pull a full report from the Vive using steam 1st and

142
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
Use the lighthouse tool in order to backup everything which you can totally do you can just dump the data

143
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
There's a directions if you look up I blew away my HTC Vive config on Reddit and there's a

144
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,287
Supposed there Adam I guess if you can like it moving forward

145
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
Bri have three LED and I have my source code here

146
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:21,087
EXC

147
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
And there's a command you can just execute at work

148
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
Moving on to the first thing I'm actually going to do here isn't going to change

149
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
Change the way the make fireworks and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say if I say

150
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
Make

151
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
Test. Hacks is also going to burn so if I

152
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Just say make

153
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
Oh wait I want to say

154
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Hake

155
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
So now if I haven't changed the code it won't update the

156
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
Dv80r so like saved now

157
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
It'll update tavr so what I can do is I can say while true do make

158
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Sleep 1.5 done bomb and so now it's going to be rain that make over

159
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:29,183
Over and over and over and over again just going to go move that off to another window so I don't have to worry about it

160
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,999
Now I'm going to go

161
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,119
Rumsey the biking again and what I can do is I can interactively

162
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
I'm going to be able to take the code here

163
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
And I'm going to be able to tweak it

164
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
In real time

165
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
So

166
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
I'm going to be able to say change this so say I want to make it to the duration of the pulse is longer right now you see it's zero

167
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,647
0481 I'm going to say make it forty whatever those units are

168
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Now if you notice it paused for a split-second that was when I save the file to change back to 30

169
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
Pause and it keeps going do you see how fast that is that's instantaneous and what's really going on

170
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Soon as I save this file it's going and it's reflashing remove this over the other

171
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,783
Other window here as soon as I save the file it goes Andre Flash

172
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
Is it in that sit avrs are awesome for really fast development cycle so

173
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
That totally

174
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
That will totally work and see what Chad is doing

175
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,943
Okay yeah nothing really that clear

176
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,575
Yeah sorry well this is not going to be that long of a the stream this is going to be a much shorter stream

177
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,207
Cuz I'm going to have to go to bed by like 12:15 cuz I'm

178
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,095
Beat it anyway. Moving forward I can change these these data the theater right here

179
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
And I can load it into

180
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,263
And I can load it up in almost immediately

181
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
Okay so you guys are actually waiting and ready to get some data

182
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Okay

183
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
240 hero 2:40 a.m. that's a bummer let's get some data okay so this is

184
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:37,439
Is the most degenerate case we see can I open up a GitHub

185
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,023
Allure are just right at out is now

186
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
Subject

187
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Create a new gist

188
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
HTC Vive Watchman

189
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
Packing session

190
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Codes

191
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
HTC Vive

192
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Watchmen codes

193
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
Start off with

194
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,119
Tavr code women actually do is when I have some Panda Vines

195
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Three as

196
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
8

197
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
4 LED 40 and

198
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
Play B-52 the side of the controller and we're only going to be operate

199
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
Waiting on that one so it's going to say LED

200
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
40

201
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,191
And we're going to just put this all together

202
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,591
So going to do here and then when I turn on LED 40

203
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,783
Wait a little bit I'm going to turn on LED 50

204
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
And then I'm going to try on LED 48

205
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,047
Okay so that should be what we need to have done I just delete that okay

206
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,143
I just saved it and it should be updating I was not why is it not updating

207
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,983
The compiler there is

208
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,823
How to find elk

209
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
Just so you guys know underscore BV is a synonym

210
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
Is a synonym for one that

211
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,375
And it has to do with the way in which AV rgcc handles 16 deaths and still having a hard time

212
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
What is it doing underscore delay

213
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
Underscore us

214
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,903
Okay so now we have three LEDs that are turning on and off

215
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
4050 + 48

216
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:29,472
Although it looks like I might have my order backwards so that's a little concerning

217
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,872
What's make sure that nothing really wacky is going on I'm sa48 50 + 40

218
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,272
4850 40 so now it's going the wrong direction

219
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
I must have

220
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
Messed up some code here let's check that out

221
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,768
Amy least get back to something sensible and then I will upload some some dumps

222
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
HT survive there is yes this one

223
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
To Lily somewhere in here

224
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,624
Just that was right I thought it was wrong for some reason but maybe I was just

225
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
40 40 50 that's wrong

226
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,176
40 Ino that's really wrong

227
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,296
4050 48 is that correct

228
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
40

229
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
54

230
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Wait what's going on

231
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
4050 48th

232
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
Does anyone have any idea why these numbers are coming in in the order they're coming in on cuz I I would not expect this code produced that out

233
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
Michigan's I just tried swatting it and I think I

234
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
4850 40

235
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
4850 40

236
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:38,496
So now it's right oh you know what I never rebuilt it that's what the problem was okay so now it's actually correct

237
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
So moving on now so this is a really basic dump and I will go

238
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
Post this to the just github just right now

239
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,952
So the way this goes is

240
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
I post my aviar

241
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Code

242
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,936
Then I post what the HTC Vive does

243
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,776
Oh and

244
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
So that a VR code there

245
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Produces

246
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Following output

247
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Donk

248
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
The output is

249
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Post 0

250
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,896
However the 16oz l number of B

251
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,832
Iemu timecode MSDS

252
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
Then

253
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
All raw light data

254
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
Echoes events

255
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
Time

256
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Colon

257
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
LED

258
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
Code Flash

259
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
Timecode one

260
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
Timecode to

261
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Flash

262
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Lady code

263
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
2

264
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
3

265
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
4

266
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,656
Notice stuff funky and coding of the numbers

267
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
And the fact that parameters are read from the end of the data

268
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Going forward

269
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,784
We know we're done when the number of parameters red is

270
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Is

271
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
Number of fights left

272
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
X

273
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
2

274
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
B w x 2

275
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
No

276
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
+ 1

277
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
Yeah that sounds right

278
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Is it

279
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,856
See what is it it is

280
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
Note

281
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,448
Raw light data ends with

282
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Free B

283
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
LSPD timecode

284
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Gotye

285
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
CRC

286
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Probably ignore

287
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,416
So see here sweet nor the last four week nor these that's one parameter to parameters three parameters

288
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
Four parameters five parameters and three values

289
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
So five

290
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,496
X 2 - 1

291
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Yeah that's actually right okay cuz if you only have one LED on you only need one for amateur cuz you only need to know the LED turned on

292
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
The time code which led it was and how long that led was on totally do it

293
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Okay let's create a public

294
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Just

295
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:51,424
I have not placed a digikey order

296
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Which by the way

297
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
Did you hear me

298
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
So I'm going to link you guys this public just

299
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,344
I see you I'm going to do some I stick it in the

300
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:17,280
Brendan do you have you don't have rights that it at least if I can add that

301
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
I can

302
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,984
Do I save

303
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,832
Okay people in chat are you ready to start

304
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:46,208
Adam which LEDs you want to have added

305
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
Civility order

306
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,144
We probably shouldn't be doing business though

307
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
In a live stream event

308
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
But any rate I have now posted the first bunch of data so this is a really simple case I want you guys

309
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,224
That's the kind of start looking at it and make sure you get a little bit more comfortable with

310
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
With what format this is in in so I guess we're going to go on from there

311
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
Is fading who's going to be looking at the state up

312
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,768
And in trying to reverse-engineer this with me

313
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
You're probably going to able to do better than I can

314
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,904
Okay good Paul so the first thing that I want to do in this is just something

315
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
I don't know

316
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:56,608
It means you can't have it pulled up in

317
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,264
And in and just whoever wants me to go more into

318
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
What the data means

319
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Just tell me and I will go I will try to go back and explain it more and understand that I

320
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
I still don't know what certain codes mean so I'm I'm just I don't know right now

321
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,696
Tried different things to create those codes and we'll see if we can figure out what they mean

322
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Nobody saying anything

323
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
Okay

324
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
That's fine I guess I will just start

325
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:52,928
Engineering the first thing I wanted to look at was if I turn on 48

326
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,584
And at the same time is 48 being on I turn on 50 so I can say or LED

327
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
48th and then I turn off LED 50 so backed up

328
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
LED 48 only

329
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
I mean okay not really awesome cuz if he didn't engineer possible we'd be done and I could move on

330
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
By the way I was up too loud the levels right I hope I got the levels

331
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,264
Okay I will add the note about

332
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
Parameter fields

333
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
Are encoded

334
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
Read from

335
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
End

336
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
Going forward

337
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,088
If value in Earth

338
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,904
MSB is

339
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Is

340
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Just in case means bail

341
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
Is is 1

342
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
Aisha rx80

343
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
It is done

344
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
If

345
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,408
Not then need to read next fight

346
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,248
I'll copy and paste the explanation from here

347
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,512
Stream brought to you by caffeine

348
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
I actually did not sleep at all Saturday night cuz I was to wire so

349
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
No caffeine for me

350
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
Any rate so I'm going to go

351
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
Update public gist

352
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Now

353
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,552
Okay so if you have the gist open refresh your page

354
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
And it will be updated for you

355
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
So the next thing I'm going to do now is we're going to look at the data

356
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,488
If I do the whole thing so fight

357
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,304
Turn on LED 4

358
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
LED 50

359
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
Watch documentaries

360
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Blank

361
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,776
Time for following

362
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
So anybody who's a tuning in now what I have is I have the AVR tape to The Watchmen controller

363
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
3 LEDs

364
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
And I have my AVR code here

365
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,608
And I can just save it and it reflash is it immediately so if I'm running this

366
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
If I change the code

367
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,728
So if I comment out this block right here

368
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
And I say save

369
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,616
It pauses and then keeps going

370
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
What I just posted was a really basic thing maybe I'll post this is another example

371
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
Call just to see how simple it can really get

372
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Okay

373
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,616
Then the more advanced one the one I wanted to show you guys that I don't understand right now

374
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:30,272
Is this one so what we're doing is returning LED 48 on 50 and 48 and then 48

375
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,088
I'm going to save that and

376
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,672
Why does it not like that

377
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
Herpa derp

378
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:56,384
Okay saved it and now it's updating so now this is a little bit more complicated

379
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,456
It turns on

380
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
For a little bit

381
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:07,648
And then just for a little led50 on for a little bit and then back off to just 48 and up

382
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,232
Uses a code that makes no sense to me

383
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,816
I'm going to go upload that here so that

384
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Produces

385
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
That

386
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,272
And then we're going to try also is swapping it around so it will be 50

387
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
48 + 50

388
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
50

389
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
So we're going to see what that looks like

390
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Notice how they are different so

391
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
Do you not understand

392
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:52,448
What's going on here so one of the things been told us last time was to take note

393
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,264
Betty's LED codes were all divisible

394
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
By 8

395
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
I'm so what that means is there is now three bits left over at the beginning of the the LED code to tell us additional in

396
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
Information

397
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
I don't know what those B do

398
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
Helpful is asking about your workflow

399
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,792
And I mention that you're probably just up and entering on and they can run this tomorrow morning

400
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:24,448
And control so I guess I should say that again

401
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
What I've done is

402
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,080
Is I have it set up over here

403
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,480
With me cantaloupe so what's going on is the system is constantly looking for new changes

404
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
New

405
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,576
New ain't anything that changes

406
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
And if it changes then it will send recompile and send the new binary to the ER

407
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,536
So if I just save the hex file

408
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:55,168
Recompile zitra flashes and now this AVR is burning new code

409
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,800
Wish I could have this hanging here so you could see it but I don't think it really matters

410
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
I'm so now if I run this and do right now is going to save the save the gist

411
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
This is going to live over there now

412
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,744
Or not how about that

413
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Yes

414
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:32,032
So does this give anybody else any ideas for things that you want to start looking at right now

415
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
I think some of the things that really Stan

416
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Mario

417
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,344
Some things that stand out to me is you see the 48

418
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
And then you see the 52

419
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,464
But the 52 is

420
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
Has the the the one set in the tooth place and the same thing is for a so

421
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,264
Over here if you look when it goes one way it's 54 and then here is 48-52

422
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,128
Until 4 a.m. is actually just 48

423
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
Text

424
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
With the two bits

425
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
48 hacks with the two bit set so something about what we've done here makes the two-bit get

426
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,560
What are the things I want to check next is to make sure that these times are doing what we think we're doing

427
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,168
Somerset at 2 instead of being 40 microseconds each I'm going to set it to 80

428
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,824
I'll keep the first one at 40 and I'll make the 80 and I'll make it 1:20 and we'll see what happens

429
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
That's not what I would have expected

430
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,088
That number does not look like a legitimate number

431
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,208
Amber looks much much larger than a legitimate number

432
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:00,352
Maybe something is wrong in my code that would identify that

433
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,216
4080

434
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,776
120

435
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,128
141 980

436
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:18,528
Okay so it is still working is I make this number bigger it makes that that value on screen this

437
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,928
Remember right here the length of appropriate Lee larger that's weird

438
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Apparently there's a maximum you can get to think

439
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,728
Oh that's weird it's like

440
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
Wraps around

441
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:56,928
Oh I'm confused now let's start small

442
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
Okay so I don't actually do

443
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
Do all three LEDs at once because I can't control which

444
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,128
Or when it starts detecting them you get like conditions were like it'll turn on turn on by I don't know which

445
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,528
Which one really turned on before the other

446
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
Yeah I don't know what's going on right now why did you guys want to look at the the streams of guinea-bissau read the numbers on my

447
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Clearly so that the 50 the the 501c

448
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:41,728
7 whatever I don't know why this is so 10 microseconds 183

449
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:47,104
20 microseconds 35640

450
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,688
Okay so is working 80

451
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:57,088
9100 Hoops 100

452
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
200-300 no 300 broken

453
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:08,608
222 40

454
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,568
3240

455
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,968
To 50 to 60

456
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
Thank you thank you I got that

457
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,680
Northfield

458
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:50,080
Thank you okay how are we going to do that then

459
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:02,111
Okay then just to make sure that this isn't going to completely get hoes I'm going to have to have to

460
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
Put a loop around the outside

461
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,079
255

462
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,807
Okay we're cooking again Charles is not all dumb

463
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
To me if I take

464
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
Take twice as long here it goes from 40 470 something 298 something so I'm

465
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Pretty

466
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,007
Pretty happy with that

467
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
3

468
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,359
Or

469
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
5

470
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,503
67

471
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:07,391
89

472
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
12

473
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
13

474
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
12

475
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
13

476
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,543
12

477
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:38,367
Okay we're going to have to remember this for later cuz I think this might might be important

478
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,791
I'm going to make a note of this in the gist that

479
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
That

480
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
Produces

481
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,727
This

482
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,407
But

483
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,111
13 produces

484
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
Nothing at all

485
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:19,071
That would mean to me that maybe what's going on there is

486
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
That maybe this values maximum is 65 530 around 6

487
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,455
Which is interesting cuz that means that maybe there's a way to encode more data above that

488
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:41,855
Cuz there's definitely date available cuz like lucketts 037 bb7

489
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:48,255
Is 64 951 so there's there's room for more information to be there and let's see what the

490
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:54,655
That actually works out to see if that's reasonable so calc so 60

491
00:44:54,911 --> 00:45:01,055
5535 / 48 millionths of a second

492
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
35 x 48 millions of a second

493
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,599
That's 1.365 milliseconds

494
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,487
I go look up the

495
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
Where's the life and I hear it is somebody who documented

496
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
What the light emissions were so that would be text 2000

497
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
Stuffed is his system should never ever be running into an LED receiving data 460

498
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,879
5000 so let's just take a note that

499
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:53,279
Note that the numbers could be to be over that

500
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,679
Is the maximum think that there might be more data there that we're just not seeing

501
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:06,079
Because it's 65,000 the representation is 037 whatever and then another number

502
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
So that leaves plenty of bits of space left and knowing then there's no way he's going to

503
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
You wasting those bets

504
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,743
Just watched a Chinaman

505
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,839
Right now so we can make fun of them right

506
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,655
Like a surprise

507
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,519
What do you mean

508
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,103
Robin earlier I thought

509
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
Okay nevermind maybe Ben is watching so let's let's go

510
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
Okay so that's interesting let's go back and keep doing the tests from where we were

511
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,023
So this one is 50/50 + 48 + 50

512
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,423
Make this 80

513
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,823
9100

514
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,951
Are you guys seeing what I'm seeing cuz this value here is definitely not

515
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:32,095
0 are not not what between the two numbers

516
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
I'm going to add that to the gist

517
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,991
Okay so there is interesting data so

518
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
50 + 48

519
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,623
But this bit here is high

520
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,463
Means that somehow between these two things

521
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,863
Is encoded the information necessary to understand that can be turned on and something and off

522
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,263
You should take that and

523
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:52,479
4

524
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:12,447
Okay

525
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,663
I don't know what to do with that that's very strange to me

526
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:27,039
Go back to 8080 and 80

527
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,927
7060

528
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,959
Do weird okay

529
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,287
Potatoes definitely doing something I would not expect

530
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,831
Okay so it looks like the major values are the same but

531
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:38,975
The minor are not does anyone mind poking at the hero me just this right now

532
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,839
So hard to get it

533
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:50,239
Did anyone mind trying to figure out what's going on there and why my code is when that particular number

534
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,847
It's large enough that could be wrong so he doesn't mind like reverse-engineering that string there

535
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,711
And making sure that I'm decoding it at least as far as we think correctly for that there

536
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:06,367
This is just thinking because if we do 4:30

537
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,767
We see the length of time go from 5:43 to 3:24 to 185 which like to meet

538
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:19,167
That makes sense like 14 but

539
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
What doesn't make sense

540
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
Is

541
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,335
Why I'm doing the same operation LED 5048 + 50 + 50

542
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,663
And that that's going on there I'm going to go back to chat now

543
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,927
Are you able to edit and put it

544
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,327
What is what are they asking

545
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,631
The GitHub project okay I'll add that

546
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:56,799
A project in the description

547
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:03,199
Adjusting the description

548
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:22,143
It is very good that navr has got more than 10,000 right Cycles

549
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
Hello

550
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:31,103
Hi is this the George that

551
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,943
That works with Kevin

552
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,343
Anyway

553
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
Moving on

554
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
So if you guys don't mind let's let's if if somebody can just double check that for me the gist

555
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,119
And try to figure out why

556
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
Oh wait somebody's commenting

557
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
I don't know what is this a this produces 48 for the LED

558
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:18,719
Okay moebius Horizons what is your name in chat who are you

559
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
See I think I saw your icon somewhere

560
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,847
Don't know what's going on

561
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,967
Yeah just does look funny

562
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,319
Oh hi Paul okay

563
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:51,999
Okay I see what you mean changing next

564
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,863
Part of me really wants to understand about that time so maybe

565
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:03,519
That's just so weird I don't know why that's the case last bit set

566
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,103
LED 50 but shows no data something else

567
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
I don't know how about this let's just try turning on different LEDs so 40

568
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
4040 so we 48 + 40

569
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
Simultaneously a how do I explain that no I'm

570
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
I'm right now we're operating only with 2 LEDs and we're already getting dated that makes no sense to me

571
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,319
That would definitely have to figure out first before we start getting into the third LED

572
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:05,727
Okay so maybe the different LED low give you a little bit of data there

573
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:12,127
That's Led 40in Led 48 and LED 40 and produces 48

574
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,527
8:42 I guess I could do it the other way around 48

575
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:24,927
48v 840

576
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:31,327
Why does that not work

577
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:41,119
How much more concise

578
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,935
Syntax for just

579
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,463
Back to the chat okay so can you guys think of any new test you want to

580
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
To run right now let me know

581
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,911
Anything else we can think of

582
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:21,311
Something that's like nice and simple

583
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:27,711
Know what else we would be able to figure out here

584
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:34,111
Maybe if we do I know we can do can turn on 40 at the same time as Forty-Eight and then turn off

585
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:40,511
LED 48 but leave 40 on and then turn it both off I'm so let's try that

586
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:22,495
That's a little bit of a difference thing there

587
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:27,359
Are that some instead of being 44

588
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Something going on here

589
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:38,879
Oh whoops there's bugs me go fix the bugs first

590
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,679
Okay okay

591
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,495
Now we can see that the code is different

592
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
Okay so now we think we got that working non-overlapping

593
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,375
Pulses

594
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:27,775
Okay Jeremy I will do that for you so LED which led should we do just LED

595
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:34,175
Lycee 48 and then 45

596
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
Like that 50 US pulse 30 pulse 70.

597
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:46,975
See what that produces k

598
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,951
Okay what else any other ideas next swap LED

599
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:24,351
Switch LEDs you want me to do the tests we did a few minutes ago like

600
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,167
This but with just different LEDs

601
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,983
So let's say 50 + 50

602
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,615
I'll be that

603
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:01,471
I guess I can do it other one yet let's do 40 and 50 at the same time

604
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:36,287
Okay come on guys need some more ideas hear anything you guys want to see

605
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,615
Daniel you had some suggestions

606
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:46,015
Variable length quantity on Wikipedia is good for explaining some Concepts

607
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,599
Brendan can you check that and see if I should add that as a

608
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,391
A link to the just

609
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:01,375
You mean you want the link no I just want you to check Wikipedia and see if it's worth adding to the gym

610
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
It's represent big eyes

611
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,951
Okay can you put the link in this thing I can pay today

612
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:32,351
20-20-20 so the time code is a big issue

613
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:41,055
Okay I can do 20 20 20 and 30 30 30 or 20 20 20

614
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
See what that looks like

615
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,919
That's 20-20-20

616
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:52,319
Make sure it actually isn't to save it yep now as a big note because

617
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:58,719
Cuz this is an analog system in here 20-20-20 depending on the order in which things

618
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:05,119
Happened that the 20 is going to be different cuz it's going to have a different analog value as it goes

619
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,423
So I will record that

620
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,727
Though for you

621
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
21 21 21

622
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
Ulta to 22 22 22 so we can make sure that it is behaving the way we

623
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
Okay.

624
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,415
Any other ideas from anybody I guess I will add this to the

625
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,047
Already tried a bunch of different timings they're available in the the document here

626
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:16,447
GTR code is sitting in the GitHub repository under the tools folder

627
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:22,847
It's already it's already there do you mean commit I guess I should

628
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:45,375
Okay

629
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:52,543
Dang anything else you guys want to stay

630
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:05,343
Oooo so

631
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,903
Sad we think that all of these times

632
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,463
Are the time

633
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:17,375
Are are the Deltas between the start time so it would go start time Delta

634
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,655
Star tile

635
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:25,055
Whatever happens at the start time like 10 transition

636
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:31,455
Before the next event happens this other thing turning on so they're all written as

637
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Delta's

638
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,951
And so yeah that would it is probably understand

639
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:48,351
So it's going to be like offset by a certain amount

640
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:53,983
Where's my turn it on for many more than there's going to be the linear and nonlinear dropping the beginning

641
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
Do you suggest another time cuz I can certainly try it

642
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,367
I guess I'll try 555 and see if it reads at all whoopsies

643
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,767
Yeah it's not even reading barely at 5 so if I did

644
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
888

645
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
That might read

646
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
Yeah that red

647
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,543
Although that did not read the way I would have expected

648
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,359
That's that's interesting

649
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,991
I don't have a you are connection but I do have a tiny ice P turn connection

650
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:47,391
Interesting idea but it would be difficult to correlate the data

651
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:57,631
Well I mean let's just see maybe I can do that

652
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:33,215
I know I have a copy that I wrote Somewhere

653
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,055
Sure let's see if it has tiny 85

654
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,623
There is a copy

655
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,183
Can just use this

656
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,447
And came from

657
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
Here

658
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,047
I'm going to include a VR print

659
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,399
I can remember how

660
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:00,511
Set up STI

661
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,471
And then we're going to do let's just

662
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,975
Yes okay we can actually get data coming back from the AVR see you guys wanted me to do it

663
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:36,351
For something I don't know how I would correlate the data though

664
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:42,495
Oh wait the people are saying other things well now I can

665
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:50,431
Oh yeah I know nobody was able to decompile the farm where we didn't find any any good thing for that

666
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:56,831
Actually if any of you guys can go find a good decompiler for 8051 could that be awesome but from what I could

667
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:03,231
Tell nobody has a decompiler for 8051 that's any good

668
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:09,631
CM Laura can you check LEDs 40 and 60 on uniform timing I cannot test l86

669
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,935
50 it is not hooked up to my controller

670
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:18,335
And I don't know my

671
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:24,735
My butt doesn't fall asleep so 30-30-30

672
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:31,135
I don't know what you want for

673
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:37,535
Susan 8051 one of the Cypress chest one of the Nordic chips that has a 8051 core and Wi-Fi

674
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:43,935
That Wi-Fi wireless it's a really funny and interfaces use the

675
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:50,335
Crfs for awhile

676
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
I totally works

677
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,775
Or does it know something's wrong

678
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:27,359
Why is code broken cook broke broke not good

679
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:36,575
Oh you know what if I do this I can only access LEDs 48 in

680
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,975
40 LED 50 is wired up to the the SPI bus for printing so I'm going to

681
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
Not do that right now

682
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:08,063
Okay everything's back to normal

683
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:14,463
Paul how much do you want the LEDs further away from

684
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,023
Cuz it does mean pulling all the tape off

685
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:32,127
VK Tuesday if you don't mind the firmware

686
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
Encrypted

687
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:36,735
And that would be super swanky

688
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:45,183
Tell you what call I will I will do you a huge favor here

689
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,719
I will

690
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:52,607
I will pull this thing off and put it on another side

691
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:33,823
Number is only with the field of which receiver is

692
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:44,063
I do not know what he is asking

693
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,439
That's interesting

694
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,039
Oh okay

695
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:19,647
Yeah I don't know how to get this set up in such a way that we can test this easily

696
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,975
Let's just do that later

697
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
Type LED 40

698
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:35,519
Probably more Operator Operator in this context

699
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:40,127
LED 50 in LED 5000 LED 40

700
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,663
Van led40

701
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,927
Okay so he wants to see oops

702
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,647
Huh

703
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:30,303
Well if you try 50th and 50th and 40th and 40 okay

704
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,607
50

705
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,375
Then

706
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,959
15 and 40 than 40

707
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:43,359
Yes it does change actually that's really interesting it changes to exactly the opposite

708
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:03,583
Watch the controller's the Watchman is the nickname for the control

709
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:08,191
For the wireless controllers

710
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:21,504
You have any other recommendations for things we can look at right now without having to try to reconfigure the physical

711
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,040
Configuration

712
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:28,672
While you're absent waiting for an answer on that Ott wants to know if there's a way that you can get

713
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,464
Summarize

714
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,864
I guess he's been recording for a little while now

715
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:45,568
How long has it been it's been an hour and 20 minutes to summarize

716
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:51,968
Sokol for the previous stream figure out what these guys did and what the wireless

717
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:58,368
Communication was because the unwired communication is very well-documented no wired stocking Tatian is documented

718
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,768
Well after we found out what your the basics was the trigger and all that I did

719
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
MyON

720
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:12,192
Then we started to try to decode the light data amazingly been one of the guys who designed these things

721
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:18,592
I'm hopin to chat and started getting us little tips and tricks and everything and then after a little while he

722
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,664
Now start giving us more and more information

723
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:28,320
And we were able to find out a number things one is there variable-length fields to his perimeter

724
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:34,720
There's are red from the back going forwards and then the echo LEDs are red from the front going back

725
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:39,072
And the number of B inside of everything started the 8th

726
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:45,728
Point-of-use variable-length field and then we found out that the last four bites for probably.

727
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,752
Kcrc

728
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:53,152
Which means we can ignore the next 3 B are probably

729
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:59,552
Delta's between different events and I definitely seen the Deltas between different events as

730
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Isaiah

731
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,696
I think that I'm pretty sure that's actually what the case is

732
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:14,144
So Paul says 10-20-30 on 4040 4840

733
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,448
So 10

734
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
2030

735
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
On

736
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,848
40

737
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
4840

738
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,784
And

739
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,832
40

740
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,952
I guess that's it

741
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,216
I know you guys probably want to keep watching that shrink down so I'm going to

742
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,496
Get here

743
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
MK

744
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,872
So this is what what Paul has requested

745
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Tom

746
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,736
Yeah you're going to lose the stream right after this so

747
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,856
Call my gosh it's so tiny

748
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,208
See here

749
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,792
So I guess what I would do is

750
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:20,960
Copy that here into

751
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:26,848
Yeah sorry guys that that Inception thing is totally done now

752
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,152
10:20 p.m.

753
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,624
I hope you're not just messing with me fall I hope you're actually thinking critically about this

754
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:05,248
Yeah it looks like that just changes the last number here which is what I would expect

755
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,312
Ojai George we haven't talked in a long time

756
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:36,480
Oh so we already are decoding all of the

757
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:42,880
The button data and I'm handling that separately and I'm pretty sure I'm doing it right and I'm handling

758
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:47,232
I'm pretty sure I'm doing that right so I should be able to

759
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,144
That's the wrong controller I should be able to click the buttons all I want and it should have little or no effect on

760
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,960
What actually gets triggered so

761
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,544
Maybe there is one or two unknown things but as

762
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,944
Play I can see it sometimes it's flashing but as you know later on we'll figure out what those two

763
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,624
Some flag turn on

764
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,984
Okay do you have anymore tests that you want to do Paul on the bow okay hi Daniel

765
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:35,104
The timings for 4452 C470 to be expected

766
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:42,272
Okay so there's something really important going on here the LEDs can't be mounted perfectly with the

767
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:49,696
Perfectly onto the dots I've gotten a free good so don't expect the numbers to

768
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,512
Do you like

769
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:55,840
Unless we exaggerate the values a lot more

770
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:01,472
First static b i e not messing with you

771
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,592
First static Vice

772
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,432
What are you referring to

773
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:25,792
Okay so originally I did this by having lighthouses on cuz I figured how hard could reading this data

774
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:32,192
And I had lighthouses on and I did a bunch of dumps and nothing made any sense at all

775
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:38,592
So we switched to using a VR to send out the pulses to the the controller because that would

776
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:42,432
Made it now I can actually control it we can see known pulses

777
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,992
About what it is

778
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,272
And

779
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:53,184
And actually look at the outfits from that so there's another test you'd like me to run ivory

780
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,560
Really like to hear it so Daniel leave if you have anything else you can think of that would be

781
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:05,216
Really cool otherwise if you guys want we can move into three LEDs now

782
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,008
To give it a shot

783
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,080
May I guess I could just do a few more tests on this like

784
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,664
I'll make this 2010 4040

785
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:18,272
Message to 1048 exaggerated a whole bunch

786
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:23,392
That was perfectly normal

787
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:47,200
Trying to figure out the meaning of the LSP flag yet the LSD that lives matter a whole bunch

788
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:52,320
I don't know what they mean it would be super cool to find out what they mean

789
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,584
40 40 40 40 50 + 40 + 50 okay let's do that one again

790
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,912
4050 + 40 + 50

791
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:31,488
By the way disclaimer like not approach this so

792
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:37,888
There are people who are much better than me but I figured it was fun to try to do this kind of has a community thing so

793
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,592
And then I guess we could look around the other way

794
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:56,832
That is interesting that the one place indicates that the bit that's on changed or something like that

795
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:26,528
Little bit actually the 66 doesn't have anymore planned projects on my radar so I don't

796
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:32,928
There is one big one that's going to be coming out

797
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:39,328
This project I'm doing with the Vive is specifically related to esp32 project that

798
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:44,448
If everything goes well and we can get everything that I want hack hacked will be able to do it

799
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:56,480
No I think I was with 50 and no it's not 82-66

800
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:00,320
Combo maybe if we can get this all figured out

801
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,208
Daniel can you tell me some more tests to run

802
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:13,376
By the way in the future if you guys can use the the formatting like 40 or,

803
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:19,776
50 or 40, 40 that will make it a lot easier for me to type the code to detest what you want to test

804
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:28,224
Spectacular idea teaching fist first cat or however you pronounce it

805
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,112
I'm going to make it 4044t

806
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:39,744
And we'll do it three times

807
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,656
That's really interesting

808
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:51,776
That's a really interesting idea

809
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,152
I like teaching first idea here

810
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
Go with it

811
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,304
Let's do it one less and see what that does

812
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:22,496
Oh wow it even does it oh guys guys look oh my gosh

813
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,896
The number it's it's it's it's big it's a big number is its

814
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:43,232
27 B permit is sub limitation Hardware right

815
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:50,400
Cannot be more where the message

816
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:56,800
Just cannot be over 29 x long and it does have to do with the hardware or 27 because

817
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,360
Cuz there's that the partial header

818
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,152
So

819
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,176
There's that

820
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:05,760
And then this one also has a really big number

821
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,064
Which is super interesting

822
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:23,424
That was a really cool testogen cat you have any other ideas

823
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,728
I'm totally up for hearing it

824
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,032
Daniel we 40-48

825
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,568
Wait what

826
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,384
48 flavor 50/50

827
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,944
Okay I guess I'll do that

828
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,040
48

829
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
48

830
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,392
50

831
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
Sissy

832
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
How many people are in the Stream

833
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
Okay

834
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
Looks like

835
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:19,488
I don't actually know

836
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:23,328
Would happen if you exceeded the limit somehow

837
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:34,848
Activate 57 new orders okay got it

838
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:41,248
Okay I hear more people out there if you have any ideas come on

839
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:47,648
We're definitely yeah that is

840
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:54,048
Is weird what is up with that

841
01:33:54,304 --> 01:34:00,448
Yeah let's let's do Saturday check let's just make sure that the LEDs are still

842
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:06,848
Directly LED 48

843
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:13,248
LED 40 LED 50

844
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:19,648
Thank goodness

845
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:26,048
Over the limit and see what happens

846
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:38,848
If you can position your windows so that they can see the real-time DIY with me

847
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:45,248
Oh this is

848
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:51,648
Wines are so of what I tried doing that okay

849
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:58,048
And it won't tell me anything

850
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:04,448
So I don't know

851
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:10,848
Well apparently if I try to go over something it would take too many

852
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:17,248
It just freaks out and stuff so don't know what to make of that

853
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:36,448
That is interesting but that seems to break it I don't know why

854
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:55,648
Oh yeah sure let's do that was also undo 2 weeks we go back

855
01:35:55,904 --> 01:36:02,048
The interesting thing

856
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:08,448
That one that is super interesting there's something about that

857
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:14,848
Number that is absolute Magic

858
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:21,248
50 48 48 48 48 5048

859
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:34,048
What are people saying

860
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:40,448
Trip suspects that pushing it over Vietnam way it's different from quest number

861
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:48,896
Daniel he's telling Paul about some of the stuff

862
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:07,072
Was asking about those two controllers a butt

863
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:14,240
I wish I could remember where Mandy said

864
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,312
Last time I want to tell you where to get it

865
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,840
Do I need to restart my session let's see what the lag is like

866
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,680
Now it looks like people weren't support quicking wide

867
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:49,568
Because you can click Lively know my session is actually behind

868
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:55,200
Yeah like

869
01:37:55,968 --> 01:38:02,112
OIC

870
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,928
Basically

871
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:09,536
I just clicked it but it didn't seem to do anything

872
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,096
Should I do it

873
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:18,496
If you guys can like somebody who has restocked the timing see if it's fact

874
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
The past

875
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,984
Any other ideas that you guys have ping ping I just finished

876
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:56,384
Right now

877
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:02,784
Okay anyway

878
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,184
Yeah okay that's good okay

879
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,584
What else should we be by the way I'm not sure if this is going to change

880
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:21,984
Somebody like that band that he couldn't get all this data down to a certain size and I think he did

881
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:28,384
Because this is stupid crazy things

882
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:53,984
Also Daniel and

883
01:39:54,240 --> 01:40:00,384
Oh gosh I've already forgotten your name you've been so helpful

884
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:06,784
Ideas for really like to hear them

885
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:25,984
Suggested looking at the B Flags

886
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:32,384
That's how it works with the timings

887
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:38,784
What time does realities from fall

888
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:45,184
Increase the delay

889
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,584
I think it is time for three LEDs

890
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:04,384
Let's do 40 84

891
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:10,784
4050 4848 40

892
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:42,784
Oh I just got myself confused

893
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:49,184
These along here

894
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:08,384
So if you guys didn't just notice eye

895
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:14,784
I just changed the 2048 47-50 48th and 4840

896
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:21,184
48 48 48 48 48 this data right here is

897
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:27,584
It is interesting that it goes 4840

898
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,984
50400 that is interesting something going on where

899
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:40,384
48 code is saying like I will be on for this long while 40 is on for this one in this way

900
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:46,784
Long oblong and then that long that is

901
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:54,464
Cuz I don't make sense 48 is going to be on for about 48 48 million

902
01:42:54,720 --> 01:43:00,864
As

903
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:48,480
Sir Paul what is your recommendation for code

904
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:56,416
Where do I get a lot of tests in cuz you guys can check

905
01:43:56,672 --> 01:44:01,024
Tomorrow I'm only going to be doing this tonight I have work to do tomorrow night

906
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:08,192
Okay we can try that

907
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,776
So play us 10

908
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,344
Oh I see okay I have to

909
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,608
Oh that's interesting though

910
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,544
Oh no nevermind that's dumb

911
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
It takes about

912
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:52,384
What is 120 hertz per fast ones

913
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:58,784
So it's divided by 4 is 30 Hertz to sweep our room so B12

914
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:05,184
34 and that operation happens to 30 her think or know 15 Hertz

915
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:18,240
Daniel can you specify what your

916
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:24,640
Actually asking for like it whenever you guys want me to try anything be as specific as possible. What you like what

917
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
Change

918
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:42,560
It's not 60 hertz it's closed but it's not 60 hertz it's not 16.66 milliseconds

919
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:51,264
I have to drop the stream to go back and get I took photodiode collected actual data from the

920
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
Lighthouses in loaded up in a logic analyzer so

921
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:09,440
Josh Moniz something else we can try maybe I'll turn on several

922
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,208
LEDs

923
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:13,792
So let's try that

924
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:18,400
Dan 4840 led50

925
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,960
Then that than that

926
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:26,848
What in the world how what

927
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,408
What

928
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,712
No Shirley

929
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:36,064
Do they really a slow more like it

930
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:29,056
Any other suggestions

931
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:35,456
Do you think he was on the project so you saying it should

932
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:45,440
It was way off I thought

933
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:52,608
Part of me wants to go get that file it might drop the stream I will

934
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,888
I'm going to try to get it

935
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,944
Did they drop the screen

936
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:16,160
Please look at the live

937
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,560
What does it say

938
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,328
Waiting

939
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:35,616
Stacy

940
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:39,200
You guys didn't see my password come out did you

941
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,624
Wife beaters flat-screen prescription

942
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:51,488
Now

943
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:36,032
So you guys know what I've done here is a diode

944
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:42,432
Chelsea was this one and this one here was on the White House

945
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:48,832
One of the things that kind of surprised me with that both lighthouses actually send out a pulse every time whether or not they send

946
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:55,232
The lighthouse

947
01:50:55,488 --> 01:51:01,632
Postcode sweet sweet sweet

948
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:08,032
This was 60 hertz

949
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:16,736
Oh wow I was completely wrong that is almost exactly 60 hertz

950
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:21,344
I have totally made a fool out of myself

951
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:29,024
What's look for the beginning flight

952
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:39,008
Okay it's exactly 60 hertz I don't know what I was looking at before that made me think it was

953
01:51:56,672 --> 01:52:01,792
So I don't know whoever that was who was it that said 60 hertz

954
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:48,640
Yeah it is

955
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:55,040
It's pretty accurate

956
01:52:55,296 --> 01:53:01,440
That I don't know what I was looking at but as you can see right here it says 16.66 or 65

957
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:04,768
6666 MS

958
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,048
Spot-on

959
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:12,448
So I guess I can close that now

960
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,496
All my CPU

961
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:24,480
Okay so what else can we test 4840 50

962
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:30,880
There I don't even understand how the even remotely possible to represent all of this

963
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:31,648
Data

964
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,976
With this few bits

965
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,256
That's just

966
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,304
Terrifying

967
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,120
It's just completely terrifying

968
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:48,288
I don't know what black magic been did but

969
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,824
What

970
01:53:55,968 --> 01:54:02,112
Also excited about the sale a I don't own a high-speed silly device I own

971
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:05,184
Only own two of the chief Chinese knockoffs

972
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:11,584
I have access to high-speed one and the only reason I have access to it is because I had the cheap Chinese

973
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,984
So if sale a had actually done something to stop people from using the cheap Chinese knockoff

974
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:24,384
They would not have made the sale so they're all up in arms about people using knockoff they lays and I'm going

975
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:28,992
Going to say that they really have to stop at if they expect to keep on selling their expensive ones

976
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:35,392
I guess I can just try a different code like

977
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:41,792
Maybe forty 4840

978
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:48,192
This is very strange

979
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,592
Congo down

980
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,512
Oh man I got to reload the chat window it's all janky

981
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:08,480
Okay well I mean is there anything else you guys can think for me to test right now so like we're doing 48

982
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:11,040
848 50s

983
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:21,024
Oh hey did you guys notice that that the huge number just now jumped to

984
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,120
42 instead of 48

985
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:47,904
And I don't even know what to try anymore this is so crazy

986
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,768
Thing and see what it does

987
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:58,912
That's interesting

988
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,048
So that one right here

989
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:30,144
It's as though it's a continuation of data somehow

990
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:36,800
I don't understand how it can represent that or how we would know for sure unless the time

991
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:41,152
Codes line up just right

992
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:47,552
Okay well it's that's neat

993
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:14,432
Okay well we got to get some ideas here

994
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,712
But what else can we test

995
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,600
I guess I could do this and then change this to

996
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:45,408
By the way I'm thinking part of the reason I couldn't sleep Saturday night

997
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:51,808
It was because I was thinking about this and what all of these different fields mean so it's totally killing me like just

998
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:56,672
Being a puzzle I want to know what the state of mean

999
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:12,544
Hey a one-day just got set did you guys see it

1000
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:20,224
Oh my gosh hold on I'm going to take this into the into the

1001
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,992
This thing

1002
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:48,896
Oh that's so weird for b51 those like the one

1003
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:55,296
Choose B have to do with it handing off while the other one is on when the fits aren't set its

1004
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:59,392
Something else is going on

1005
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:06,816
Back to the previous

1006
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:13,728
Four-wheel not I don't think four will read but we can try it

1007
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:18,080
4 is barely reading

1008
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:21,152
Text should read

1009
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:26,272
Still not quite reading 8

1010
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:32,672
8 reeds

1011
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,328
Let's be safe to make a 10

1012
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,752
I don't know man

1013
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,616
Let's go back to a more degenerate Templar case

1014
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:57,920
Back window

1015
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:04,064
So I want to just do this 40 4840 4850

1016
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:31,200
One other note if you look up here you can see what happens when the pulse codes Leach over into the next frame

1017
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:58,080
I don't think we're losing anything in the packet limit because there was that one packet back a couple wear

1018
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,360
Are it on

1019
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:03,456
Where it just went down to the next packet I'll show you

1020
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,560
So here check this out

1021
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:22,144
What's going on it's going down to the next packet

1022
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,896
14 what does it look like on actual Watchman data

1023
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:45,856
Oh you know what I don't even have any way of collecting the Rawhide data coming from a wired Watchmen

1024
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,696
I haven't written that I never did never thought I'd use it

1025
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:52,000
Be too hard to get right now

1026
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,472
How do you just make more events and see what happens

1027
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:53,696
5448 5048 5048

1028
02:06:54,208 --> 02:07:00,352
Oh that's really clever oh okay so what they're doing if it would be something that would breach pack

1029
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:06,752
The time code

1030
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:12,640
So right here

1031
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:19,040
This is actually just treating it as separate 4850 4850 4850 48

1032
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:25,440
And then this one here is saying 40 was on from here until you know whatever the packet

1033
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:28,512
And was so happy the wrong line

1034
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:43,872
Or I guess I'll be the opposite what really happened is it was this one

1035
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,968
No

1036
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:59,488
Yes okay so if you look at this Packer right here the time code started before

1037
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:03,840
This packet so the system was smart enough to know 22 take

1038
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:05,376
The

1039
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:07,168
The 40

1040
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:12,288
Neither was common to all of these and then go stick it after this packet

1041
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:18,688
Even though the event started in this time before this packet again so the things I just don't have to come in in order

1042
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:25,088
It just I guess it's really clever about the wages stores them and sends them on Word

1043
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:29,440
Going to be as hard cuz maybe it does a lot of the really hard

1044
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:31,488
Work

1045
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:48,128
I understand that I don't have

1046
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:51,200
I just don't have any way of decoding it right now

1047
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,112
Oh hey benzon here

1048
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,392
Hi Ben

1049
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:08,608
And then if if if the factory has has it it be really cool

1050
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:13,984
Let me go let me go commit the current just

1051
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:28,064
I think you can see just how many people are really excited to figure out what this is

1052
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:35,232
The one thing that I want to say is I never I cannot fathom what it took in order

1053
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:40,352
To write something that could look at the light pulses and figure out how to

1054
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:44,192
Put these crazy things together

1055
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:53,152
Other ideas for different.

1056
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:57,248
Maybe this one right here

1057
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:02,112
What

1058
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:06,464
I mean oops and I realized what I did

1059
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:22,336
Apartments

1060
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,352
Check that out guys the

1061
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,144
The Forbidden set

1062
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,168
And that one

1063
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:09,184
Maybe the forest B oh my gosh wait are you guys already talking about this

1064
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:15,584
Before B might be the the B that that that the turn off

1065
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,984
When the thing like 49 is 48

1066
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,288
In10sity is 50 + 1

1067
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,568
Nevermind

1068
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:31,200
Building 44

1069
02:11:53,984 --> 02:12:00,128
So

1070
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:06,528
Play let me change the numbers of the timing some so I can make sure that ice I'm seeing what I'm seeing

1071
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:23,424
Yeah I know I'm still lost although hey this does prove that it's Delta's I mean despite the fact

1072
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:29,824
Actually show that it has to be deltas

1073
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:36,224
Orbit here and the fact that it affected something that was all the way to back

1074
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:42,624
Where is the one day I think it only affects one understanding

1075
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:49,024
Turning into 4948 5244

1076
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:55,424
And that would have meant that it was looking to back instead of further back I don't know how to

1077
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:59,008
It's hard to put that into words

1078
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:16,160
Been in chat can you tell us what it's like to have a bunch of people

1079
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:22,560
Call trying to solve a problem that you already know the solution to a puzzle

1080
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:28,960
The puzzle looks like and where all the pieces go and try to figure it out

1081
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:45,600
That's a good point I really should tweet this out

1082
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,976
I guess there's no information on my Twitter that you guys can't

1083
02:13:54,048 --> 02:14:00,192
Actually you know what I don't have the URL for this life pecan somebody pays to life

1084
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:06,592
YouTube flashlight flashlight

1085
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,920

1086
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:16,320
Saint Laurent / C / 4/5

1087
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:22,720
Reply

1088
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:56,256
Oh are you serious VK Tuesday

1089
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:02,656
I think it's worth

1090
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:07,008
So Ben says it's pretty entertaining

1091
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:12,384
What's the LG Q

1092
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,176
Dlco

1093
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,728
Okay

1094
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,776
Back to work

1095
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:45,920
Okay so let's see here what would I change next to try to tweak that b

1096
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:56,416
Oh hey sex we got a sex again

1097
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,696
We got to fix again

1098
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:01,024
Let's take a look at that

1099
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:27,904
Put led50 on for the whole time

1100
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:35,072
Omica

1101
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,608
That's sad

1102
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:43,776
Mike can you please tell us what the what the toy was or is are you under NDA to tell us what it is

1103
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:53,760
Oh so you want 50 on okay Sophie

1104
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:54,784
50

1105
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:59,392
I want to make this 40

1106
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:13,216
Say what

1107
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:18,080
Mike answered you

1108
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:33,184
So if you are interested in seeing the 6th so I guess the sex

1109
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:38,560
How I done goofed something else is that the right one

1110
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:41,120
49-42

1111
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:44,192
Jesse's led50 is on the whole time

1112
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:50,592
That is very strange why

1113
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,128
So how does it

1114
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:53,408
What is it doing

1115
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:07,232
You can ask for a brief description of your Hardware software setup

1116
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:11,584
What is 6000

1117
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,120
Never heard of this

1118
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:20,032
Sorry I'm right now just looking up something that one of the guys in chat help program

1119
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:23,360
M60 accuse I've never seen these

1120
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,408
It looks pretty

1121
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:27,968
Was it like for game

1122
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:35,392
It's pretty neat that they got little displays and he said I got there Wireless

1123
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,560
Hey 5000 is that

1124
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:45,888
Did hack your stuff

1125
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:49,984
So I would say special

1126
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:51,776
Micah

1127
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,824
Sorry yeah my cat looks like

1128
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:57,664
You're supposed to get back to work

1129
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:05,088
So what did you say okay it's time to show

1130
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:11,488
Okay very briefly hardware and software setup I have a watch

1131
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:15,072
Fan controller here that I have taped on with the

1132
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:17,120
3 LEDs

1133
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:23,008
On different parts of the controller and I have the code setup here so if I save it

1134
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:29,664
Keeps running so I can change which LEDs are on and how and basically real-time

1135
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,760
Immediately

1136
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:40,160
And what I've been doing is copying and pasting the output from The Watchmen into the gist thing right there

1137
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:44,256
And as usual

1138
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,816
That is my

1139
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:47,840
Girlfriend

1140
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:51,936
So you wrote an article about it

1141
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:57,312
What

1142
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:00,128
I'm not sure which

1143
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,920
This the picture here

1144
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:07,552
Oh wait we really got to get back to work I'm sorry

1145
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:14,208
Micah saying the SDK that repo includes the hardware simulator

1146
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:19,328
Ron's emulated binary translated firmware oh so you actually like wrote that code

1147
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:27,264
Survive right now

1148
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:33,664
I'm going to hopefully you get this working more and then we'll have lights or 5 so can actually read all of the lighting Gator from

1149
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:40,064
And hopefully in time we will be able to pass the data off to David Chapman's algorithms

1150
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:46,464
In order to locate the position and run the Kalman filter and all of that to figure out where exactly everything is

1151
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:52,864
I'm a little bit curious if it's really necessary especially because I'm interested in that because

1152
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:59,264
Cuz I noticed when I had the headset on and I could do certain things that looks like it's using an IR to do the correction in the

1153
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:05,664
Headset but but I just want to see what happens if we try to use it

1154
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:12,064
Common filter instead of and I are eventually

1155
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:18,464
Get this Poky Little laptop right here like little second gen I5

1156
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:24,864
Painfully slow to be able to actually run five games all Scott is integrated graphics

1157
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:31,264
Games I mean like a Vive games that I write for it specifically written to be fast and Tiny

1158
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:37,664
We really got to keep moving though we're going to get some more data here to figure out what's going on

1159
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:43,040
I guess one thing I could try this point is we could

1160
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:45,856
Do that

1161
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:52,512
And then f****** I'm curious what happens if

1162
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:01,472
Oh hey guys check that out that day changed

1163
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:03,520
Let's do this one

1164
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:22,720
I'm really got to figure out what's going on with it transfer problem for with the lighthouse

1165
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:25,280
I don't know what's going on there

1166
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:34,752
Can you look at the band hand and see if we can make use of that Brendan

1167
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:39,616
Slippery out there

1168
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:42,944
Its first 12 and 1st

1169
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:47,552
From band

1170
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,184
It's

1171
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:55,488
First one to end first

1172
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:59,328
Savannah saying it's quote first one to end first

1173
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:03,168
Post a policy cyborg movie

1174
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:06,752
Do the the least significant didn't know

1175
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:09,824
First one to end first

1176
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:14,688
Oh my gosh what does that mean

1177
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:34,912
Why is it so hard

1178
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:41,312
But

1179
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:43,360
Copy paste the wrong thing

1180
02:23:56,416 --> 02:24:01,792
I'm I'm going to go back and look at shortly but

1181
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:07,424
Hi you don't know when it will and you can't report it until it ends

1182
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:09,984
So they come out to me order that net

1183
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:25,856
But I don't know if you saw earlier when we got it stacked up enough that there was one LED

1184
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:32,256
It was on for a long time while we were doing other stuff and she came in and said that like

1185
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:38,656
We're done in the next message down so that the neat idea of the way that you were able to to make that

1186
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:39,680
Like

1187
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:44,800
Walk down to the next one but they come out in the order they end

1188
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:57,088
That says him beginning to end and then it says the date at mediately

1189
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:05,024
Wait a minute does that mean wait a minute does that mean

1190
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:11,168
That could mean that the kind that were receiving is the time code of the end

1191
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:18,080
Not a no-fault we know it's not time to go to the end because if we go back up to that packet that was on the other line

1192
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:21,664
The time code started before the previous

1193
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:23,200
Packets timecode

1194
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:25,248
That was

1195
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:28,576
This one here

1196
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:35,488
S timecode is actually less than the first

1197
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,632
And so we know the time code in the packet

1198
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:48,544
Corresponds to

1199
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:50,336
The start

1200
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:52,384
Edge of the

1201
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:56,736
Event not the tailing Edge

1202
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,272
Of the event

1203
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,808
I hope

1204
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,536
Must be painful for you to watch

1205
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:12,096
Just watch her squirm

1206
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:33,344
I can't explain lsb's in terms of his current code

1207
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:40,256
He got to fix the time decode first

1208
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:58,688
No I'm watching my gosh this computer is too slow

1209
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:03,552
Wait no what what

1210
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:06,880
Sahuarita one the year it starts at the end

1211
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:14,048
Put the Stars not at the

1212
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:20,448
Got2b of the start event because I started the LED and then let it play and then it came in later with an earlier start time

1213
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:25,824
Find select the time has got to be the beginning of all of the events right

1214
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:39,136
I'm sad offsets reversed

1215
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:56,800
Yes I can no I can't correlate time

1216
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,568
Accurately

1217
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:29,312
When I say event I mean transitions or on or off or anything like that

1218
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:43,136
No we we are I mean I don't know bad if you get a chance to look through the

1219
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:49,792
The copious amounts of tests we run to try to understand what's going on

1220
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:55,424
Also I still don't know what's up with that big number in this test we got here going to go be there

1221
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,520
Let's let's keep looking

1222
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:26,656
Are you right now we have been here don't don't go off in the middle of nothing right now

1223
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:45,856
I don't think that we're running into anything like that I think we're a lot closer than r l e

1224
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:52,256
I don't I think that I would have thought that at first but not after

1225
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:58,656
Everything everything we've seen

1226
02:29:58,912 --> 02:30:05,056
I'm still having a hard time

1227
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:11,456
Wrapping my head around what Ben said what kind of want some confirmation

1228
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:17,856
Let's look at it

1229
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:24,256
Read it again cuz I am trying to like to alt-tab between everybody all this much

1230
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:30,656
You can report it till it on I don't know when it will end right that's why

1231
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:37,056
Yeah there are two end-to-end

1232
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:43,456
We did know that all that was from yesterday so we come in the order

1233
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:49,088
At the end of think about the LEDs

1234
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:55,488
So I've been riding them in the order from this way this way that way

1235
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:57,792
50 riding on that way instead

1236
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:13,920
So I'm reading

1237
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:22,368
Can you guys think of a test that I can caulk where I would turn on One LED and then turn on and

1238
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:28,768
Different LED and then turn off that led on a different one in order to determine if

1239
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:35,424
Like which order they're actually in if somebody can like write the syntax again for

1240
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:45,152
Saudi I guess we should be able to tell that should be

1241
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:46,688
Temple should be

1242
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:41,984
Can you check the chat Brandon

1243
02:32:55,040 --> 02:33:01,184
44-year 4844 Lucas

1244
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:07,584
40 40 40 Lucas if you can just type in the time chat if this is what you were wanting me to test

1245
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:13,984
48 / 84

1246
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:26,784
4040 + 40

1247
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:33,184
Wait

1248
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:39,584
Do Marker

1249
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:45,984
Daniel Lee

1250
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:58,784
Just warning you Daniel this is going to overlap if I do it there's going to be no way of actually knowing

1251
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:05,184
Oh I see what you're saying

1252
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:11,584
She's been like that

1253
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:43,584
Okay Daniel Lee I just added your stuff

1254
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:49,984
To the baguette

1255
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:56,384
There is a correlation between LED 40 + 10 + 6

1256
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:02,784
Therapy

1257
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:09,184
I don't see it

1258
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:15,584
He must be looking at a different dataset other will be

1259
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:21,984
Correlations between LEDs and certain numbers though because the timing will be consistent among those LEDs

1260
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:58,848
Does anybody have any idea what could have meant when he said I needed to fix my timing code because I just don't know

1261
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:05,248
I mean the same as what's what's up there

1262
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:16,768
Okay I'll try 40 + 48

1263
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:23,168
Oh no overlap Oso

1264
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:35,968
Okay so what's going on right here I'm

1265
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:42,368
I'm also seeing a massive number right there

1266
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:48,768
Like I have no idea where that came from

1267
02:36:55,424 --> 02:37:01,568
Like seriously what is up with this why is there 283,000

1268
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:07,968
Showing up right there I mean I guess I could just

1269
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:34,592
Can you go back and start looking again

1270
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:40,992
Also I think he means that the timings

1271
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:47,392
Correlated sink 1 trillion with utilities oe mean I really could be looking at the LEDs

1272
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:53,792
In Arduino if it's reverse order yet

1273
02:37:54,048 --> 02:38:00,192
But enough of the first led you read it was not necessarily the first.

1274
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:18,112
No no no no no John we we want this to be all in good fun we're trying to do something fun with

1275
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,136
Hardware

1276
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:29,632
On that possible tie what do you what do you recommend

1277
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:38,336
You guys like using that or Note 8

1278
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:39,104
Station

1279
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:46,784
Don't ask the chat what is 2 to the 1818 is 26

1280
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:50,880
50144 right pulling out of thin air

1281
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:52,416
Maybe

1282
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:54,976
I certainly don't know to the 19

1283
02:38:56,256 --> 02:39:02,400
If you can make a recommendation for what code you would have checking

1284
02:39:13,152 --> 02:39:17,504
We're getting we're getting close to the to the cutoff sign here

1285
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,856
1

1286
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:30,304
What is what is the next 10 min

1287
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:36,704
Set 10

1288
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:49,504
George II just don't know

1289
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,320
Don't know what you're after

1290
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:05,376
Oh are you serious

1291
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:09,216
Wait a minute who is the one who asked what's 2 to the 18

1292
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:16,384
Is that one of the other valves that I missed the name

1293
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:22,784
Is he one of the other valve think he was ya know why did I have to poop

1294
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:25,856
I'm sorry

1295
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:33,280
I still don't understand, what do you want me to test you want to do this twice

1296
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:35,072
Like that

1297
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:42,752
Oh that's

1298
02:40:43,008 --> 02:40:43,776
Weird

1299
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:46,336
I did not what

1300
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:48,640
I don't

1301
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:57,344
Why is this that output

1302
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:13,728
This is crazy

1303
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,736
In the world

1304
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:34,208
Why is

1305
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:46,240
More suggestions

1306
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:59,040
Is the fundamental time because wrong he also asks that maybe

1307
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:06,464
I mean I just said it to the 14th so let me go back

1308
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:12,864
For they to dk20 there is

1309
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:19,264
Earlier on I don't know if you were here when but at the time

1310
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:25,664
That number's up 255 35 so the fact that it's more than 50 55-35 means

1311
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:32,064
Yes I know that there's Flags there but I've no idea what O2 the 18

1312
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:38,464
A bit too which is a bit that matters for us

1313
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:44,864
So the two-bit could be in the LED code or it could be in the time code if shifted

1314
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:50,752
Like timecode pushed up

1315
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:54,080
16 deaths I think

1316
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,872
Yeah

1317
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:59,712
That's interesting

1318
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:02,272
So

1319
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:41,952
That live around for quite some time when Charles did not realize the important question

1320
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:46,304
That was being asked

1321
02:43:56,288 --> 02:44:02,432
Hold on

1322
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:12,416
Ben

1323
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:18,816
I am I would not be surprised if what you've done here compresses the data

1324
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:25,216
Better than any normal compression algorithm that one would typically be a

1325
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:31,616
Able to use like this is some very clever stuff to minimize the number of fights that are being transfer

1326
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:38,016
I do wish I was a little bit sharper right now I'm definitely getting tired

1327
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:44,416
So then we had just discussed that

1328
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:50,816
Who says getting there I'm guessing he was referring to me when he went

1329
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:58,240
The whole thing about 2 to the 18

1330
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:04,640
Tapping into the twos bit of

1331
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:08,736
Or whatever it is

1332
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:20,512
Instead of

1333
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:25,120
The to spit of

1334
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:29,728
The LED code

1335
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:47,136
So what did I miss

1336
02:45:57,376 --> 02:46:03,519
The time between one set of 3xd of marker and the next is too short

1337
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:12,479
Combine two covid-19

1338
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:25,279
Yeah or a bit in like

1339
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:31,679
And it's only going to take it's going to take

1340
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:38,079
Talking to you like a lot and you don't have to store another by telling you that it's up there

1341
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:45,503
I hope a bunch of these folks are like really thinking this one through like Paul and

1342
02:46:45,759 --> 02:46:48,319
And everyone else cuz

1343
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:54,207
We're totally going to have to dig this went through cuz my brain is pretty fried at the moment

1344
02:46:57,279 --> 02:47:03,423
So let's see what conditions can we put it under in which case the two will appear in there

1345
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:08,543
Instead of in there for the to spit for whatever

1346
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:10,591
If I don't do that

1347
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:17,759
Maps 40-48 with the Tuesday stuffed there

1348
02:47:28,767 --> 02:47:33,631
And I bet you if we flip the order of those then it'll appear in the other one

1349
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:36,447
48 48 48

1350
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:41,823
No it didn't

1351
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,615
A great what does that mean

1352
02:47:55,391 --> 02:48:00,767
Oh and about the whole timing thing like which ones happens first

1353
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:13,055
How much if I leave this one on set that 2:40 then it'll appear in there yet did okay

1354
02:49:40,351 --> 02:49:46,495
Why is the two-bit set now

1355
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:55,711
Well I must put up with me like tattoos b means these two

1356
02:49:55,967 --> 02:50:02,111
Things have nothing to do with each other and that it's not actually carry over from

1357
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:08,511
Okay let's wait a minute no nevermind yeah yeah

1358
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:14,911
What's going on here guys do Marker 1048 + 250

1359
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:21,311
So 250 corresponds to led40 here even though it happens

1360
02:50:21,567 --> 02:50:27,711
S sequentially in time so it's like backwards from from the order that you expected

1361
02:50:27,967 --> 02:50:33,855
So what in the world does that one did in the Dare do why does that happen

1362
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:40,255
Cuz like look guys this going to copy this over there you guys are probably

1363
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:43,071
Anyway so

1364
02:50:43,327 --> 02:50:46,655
But that's like super interesting

1365
02:50:46,911 --> 02:50:53,055
Why is the order reversed

1366
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:09,439
Okay going up some

1367
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:23,775
By ticking Fritz the Cat

1368
02:51:43,231 --> 02:51:46,815
I'm just reading what everybody saying I haven't got a chance to do that in a bit

1369
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:55,775
What

1370
02:51:56,031 --> 02:52:02,175
You can't go why

1371
02:52:02,431 --> 02:52:08,575
Albert thing would that do Marker LED at4050 I mean we can do that

1372
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:14,975
ATR 40 and 50 are going to come on at I'm not going to

1373
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:21,375
And off cuz like there is a slight like

1374
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:27,775
Like the way but I don't know what it is

1375
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:59,775
By Paul thank you for joining please look at it tomorrow please please please that would be super cool

1376
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:06,175
Call cuz I'm pretty sure I'm not going to figure out what's going based on all of this

1377
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:12,575
The basics

1378
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:18,975
Sequences misinterpreted the order that I'm reading in or what cuz I'm pretty sure that I'm not misinterpreting it because

1379
02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:25,375
If I end up with extra bites or anything like that that I print out a warning and so far I haven't seen any

1380
02:53:25,631 --> 02:53:28,191
The warnings

1381
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:52,255
So that's the other thing

1382
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:58,655
When I the whole reverse thing Paul if you can just stick around for a second

1383
02:53:58,911 --> 02:54:05,055
I do want to show you why I think that that's not the case if I do LED 40

1384
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:11,455
LED 50

1385
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:17,855
LED 48 and LED 40

1386
02:54:18,111 --> 02:54:24,255
And I do 20 30 40 50

1387
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:30,655
Keep that then I guess 4050 4840 4050 4840

1388
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:37,055
So I don't think that they're reversed I think they're in the correct order

1389
02:54:37,311 --> 02:54:43,455
Does not what was his name is saying but it doesn't

1390
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:56,255
The negative one at the very end placeholder I put in it's not in the package is not there

1391
02:54:56,511 --> 02:54:57,791
It's just a thing I stuck in

1392
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:02,911
El William if you want we can work together

1393
02:55:04,191 --> 02:55:07,007
But to be fair I do kind of want to work on mine

1394
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:12,895
Who knows we can just eat work on our our own and then just share the knowledge

1395
02:55:27,231 --> 02:55:32,095
At any rate is I was saying I'm pretty sure that the order is correct cuz like 40

1396
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:35,167
Is first 50 is second

1397
02:55:35,423 --> 02:55:36,959
48/3

1398
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:38,495
+ 40 is

1399
02:55:38,751 --> 02:55:42,079
The last one and they also go up to the time here goes up

1400
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:48,479
And feel like in the degenerate case it's clear that it's 40 on 4309 off 430 150 on 45

1401
02:55:48,735 --> 02:55:54,879
25 off for 2948 on 4691 and then offered 3:15 and 4

1402
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:56,927
40 on 4 873

1403
02:55:58,463 --> 02:56:02,559
On and then it turns off cuz it's the end of the packet

1404
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:16,127
You catch the B right sequence wrong

1405
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:22,783
No

1406
02:56:23,039 --> 02:56:26,879
B what

1407
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:30,207
Why is the negative one at the very end for example

1408
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:35,839
Oh no the negative one is is the mawp I think I said

1409
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:40,959
Your order only comes from the first few bites were talking about the rest of the day. He says

1410
02:56:41,983 --> 02:56:46,591
Diid use various plotting programs when it makes sense to but right now

1411
02:56:47,103 --> 02:56:52,735
I mean like when I come feel like moving the thing around I'm totally going to do it but right now we're just trying to figure out what the Rob B R

1412
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:01,951
William let's go take a look at your code

1413
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:06,047
EBenefits

1414
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:10,143
I'm your sequence of numbers applies the first few bites but the assignment

1415
02:57:11,423 --> 02:57:14,239
The timestamps might be wrong

1416
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:18,847
I'm taking notes for myself so I can read these tomorrow

1417
02:57:19,103 --> 02:57:25,247
I don't know standstill here if he is is it okay if I like actually post the text of everything he said

1418
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:26,783
Along with the thing

1419
02:57:30,623 --> 02:57:36,767
You guys want to like work on something and then like link

1420
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:43,167
Something that would be cool to like and

1421
02:57:49,823 --> 02:57:53,663
I need a thing of water I'm going to just do a quick commercial break

1422
02:57:58,527 --> 02:58:00,831
What what really

1423
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:06,719
I can't click

1424
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:09,023
What

1425
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:13,119
Extreme is totally live

1426
02:58:25,407 --> 02:58:28,223
Bummer I just don't have access to that button

1427
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:31,807
Well you guys are going to have to just sit there without a commercial break or anyting

1428
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:41,535
I'm going to leave it there

1429
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:07,903
What what is

1430
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:09,951
Just in general

1431
02:59:10,975 --> 02:59:13,023
I still don't have an ad button now

1432
02:59:19,679 --> 02:59:23,263
Oh well I don't know why that is

1433
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:34,015
That's okay

1434
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:51,423
I feel really bad because I feel like I can get into the Zone more when I when I'm the one who's working in focus

1435
02:59:51,679 --> 02:59:54,239
Based on the problem but when I'm like kind of

1436
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:59,615
Hurting everybody I can't really get into the zone so I feel almost a little embarrassed

1437
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:01,663
So dull right now but

1438
03:00:02,175 --> 03:00:03,711
I guess that's just how it is

1439
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:10,111
I think you guys are having more fun with it this way and I'm having fun too and as long as the problem gets solved

1440
03:00:10,367 --> 03:00:11,391
I guess I'll be happy

1441
03:00:14,463 --> 03:00:15,743
Hi Paul

1442
03:00:18,047 --> 03:00:19,071
McDaniel

1443
03:00:27,519 --> 03:00:28,543
I don't know

1444
03:00:52,095 --> 03:00:55,679
Videos

1445
03:00:59,007 --> 03:01:01,311
Creative Commons ads from the 50s

1446
03:01:01,567 --> 03:01:03,871
Talk about it that's pressive

1447
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:10,271
By the way you guys should totally

1448
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:14,367
Brandon said talk about expressive so it's going to totally do

1449
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:20,255
Two people from the comments

1450
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:23,071
Expressive

1451
03:01:23,327 --> 03:01:29,471
They have like

1452
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:30,495
Animation

1453
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:36,639
This guy

1454
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:46,623
They're this thing he totally made an ad

1455
03:01:47,647 --> 03:01:48,671
Look at that add

1456
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:53,023
Look at it just all cool and look who was Francis

1457
03:01:54,815 --> 03:01:56,607
Okay back to work

1458
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:04,031
Does anyone have any ideas right now

1459
03:02:04,543 --> 03:02:05,823
Look at the Twitter pic

1460
03:02:09,151 --> 03:02:10,175
Did you

Alright

1465
03:02:43,199 --> 03:02:46,271

03:02:48,575 --> 03:02:50,367
Tk20se

1468
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:53,695
How is that Allen

1469
03:02:57,023 --> 03:02:58,815
Bk2 Z28

1470

So Tuesday is not really on you but he send me a picture

1471
03:03:05,983 --> 03:03:07,775
He tweeted picture

1472
03:03:09,567 --> 03:03:11,871
Maybe to send your Twitter mentions

1473
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:13,407
See

1474
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:16,479
I'll see a picture though

1475
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:19,039
Oh

1476
03:03:19,807 --> 03:03:21,599
Oh now I see it

1477
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:28,255
Call yok

1478
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:32,607
Puzzles are getting so ridiculous

1479
03:03:34,655 --> 03:03:36,191
02

1480
03:03:36,959 --> 03:03:38,751
34

1481
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:42,079
150

1482
03:03:42,847 --> 03:03:47,199
Oh well you know what let's see what that looks like

1483
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:49,759
I'm going to save this picture

1484
03:03:54,879 --> 03:04:01,023
Oh my gosh okay I can't wait to see what then I'll put

1485
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:02,047
Turns into

1486
03:04:03,583 --> 03:04:05,631
Kemal

1487
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:10,239
Hey hi, thank you for using is all good

1488
03:04:18,943 --> 03:04:19,455
Okay

1489
03:04:19,711 --> 03:04:23,039
Time for us to go see

1490
03:04:23,807 --> 03:04:29,951
That picture actually does for us so I'm going to take that picture I'm going to go

1491
03:04:30,207 --> 03:04:36,351
I'll put it into code in Cisco dled

1492
03:04:36,607 --> 03:04:42,751
20 Led Led 50 or 40

1493
03:04:43,007 --> 03:04:49,151
LED 50 boom there than LED

1494
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:55,551
50 or LED 48

1495
03:04:55,807 --> 03:05:01,951
And then LED

1496
03:05:02,207 --> 03:05:08,351
50 Min nothing sets first transition off

1497
03:05:08,607 --> 03:05:12,703
Second transition of first transition down

1498
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:15,007
Second transition

1499
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:19,359
S transition down transition down

1500
03:05:19,871 --> 03:05:22,431
Okay so this coach should be

1501
03:05:45,983 --> 03:05:47,519
Are you guys seeing this

1502
03:05:48,287 --> 03:05:50,079
Cuz I'm really confused now

1503
03:05:53,151 --> 03:05:54,431
41

1504
03:05:55,455 --> 03:05:56,991
Transition one

1505
03:05:58,783 --> 03:05:59,807
48

1506
03:06:01,087 --> 03:06:02,111
Nothing

1507
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:08,255
50

1508
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:09,023
3

1509
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:11,839
53 is it

1510
03:06:12,351 --> 03:06:13,631
Going

1511
03:06:14,399 --> 03:06:16,191
Want o

1512
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:22,335
The one needs is associated with the first

1513
03:06:28,223 --> 03:06:34,367
4848 only on 4

1514
03:06:34,623 --> 03:06:40,767
For a little bit does not associate with any other events

1515
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:47,167
NY 53

1516
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:54,335
No I want to figure it out here cuz I think the 53

1517
03:06:54,591 --> 03:07:00,735
The one means it's one the event is one away from where I am and then the three would mean that

1518
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:07,135
123 away that's one event

1519
03:07:07,391 --> 03:07:10,207
2 event back 3 event back

1520
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:16,607
And it's an implicit one so it's the amount that it changes so

1521
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:27,359
Well let me at least copy this since the text file and then

1522
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:18,303
Okay you're right. It does make a little bit easier cuz you can clearly see like 867

1523
03:08:19,071 --> 03:08:20,607
The 151

1524
03:08:23,423 --> 03:08:25,727
That's such a good test but it's

1525
03:08:25,983 --> 03:08:32,127
I don't have enough brain cells still firing to figure out exactly how to decode that but the 41 means it's 40

1526
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:36,479
Forward them out

1527
03:08:38,527 --> 03:08:39,551
And then

1528
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:43,135
151

1529
03:08:44,671 --> 03:08:48,255
Oh me so it's 40 then 151 later

1530
03:08:52,607 --> 03:08:55,679
Now the B20 so

1531
03:09:00,543 --> 03:09:04,383
Where in the world why the 552 there the 48

1532
03:09:13,855 --> 03:09:17,439
Okay so that's on but then the one

1533
03:09:36,383 --> 03:09:39,199
Which Delta a different prime number for testing

1534
03:09:44,831 --> 03:09:47,647
Yes but we're getting there

1535
03:10:01,471 --> 03:10:03,007
Everytime You groan like that

1536
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:07,871
Pittsboro Matt's dog looks around and groans back

1537
03:10:08,127 --> 03:10:12,479
Somebody just read me the thing about everytime I groan this dramatic dog groans

1538
03:10:24,511 --> 03:10:30,655
By the way you guys do kind of have a bad voice synthesizer playing back everything cuz

1539
03:10:30,911 --> 03:10:33,983
A phases here reading things that matter

1540
03:10:53,183 --> 03:10:59,327
Okay fine what I really should be doing right now is like

1541
03:10:59,583 --> 03:11:05,727
The numbers round to approximate numerical values that match up with

1542
03:11:05,983 --> 03:11:06,751
Please tell

1543
03:11:07,775 --> 03:11:09,311
So I think that would be

1544
03:11:09,567 --> 03:11:15,711
Better use of my time Lego speed this up some and then it'll lineup better

1545
03:11:58,463 --> 03:12:04,607
Okay so what I did hear just you guys can say is I modified the oscillator clock on the

1546
03:12:04,863 --> 03:12:11,007
Maybe our one of these is approximately 10 times the total number 48 millions of a sec

1547
03:12:11,263 --> 03:12:17,407
I can fit these are representing so 12

1548
03:12:17,663 --> 03:12:23,807
8 that way not a 125 7-Eleven is that

1549
03:12:24,063 --> 03:12:25,855
The next prime I guess

1550
03:12:27,647 --> 03:12:29,183
Okay

1551
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:35,583
What why why is there a why did the Jews bit just turn on and

1552
03:12:35,839 --> 03:12:41,215
To the d-18 thing

1553
03:12:42,239 --> 03:12:48,383
What's what is that doing there

1554
03:12:49,919 --> 03:12:50,431
Polyps

1555
03:12:50,687 --> 03:12:51,967
Go back to

1556
03:13:02,975 --> 03:13:04,255
Okay

1557
03:14:13,375 --> 03:14:17,215
Oh bother with that

1558
03:14:17,471 --> 03:14:23,615
Average iq

1559
03:14:23,871 --> 03:14:30,015
Never seen that one

1560
03:14:38,207 --> 03:14:39,487
Back to work

1561
03:14:43,583 --> 03:14:44,351
I'm going

1562
03:14:53,567 --> 03:14:58,687
Adam Gary just got back and asked how it's going and I'm sighing heavily

1563
03:14:58,943 --> 03:15:03,295
47

1564
03:15:03,807 --> 03:15:09,951
I have no idea why there's a to like

1565
03:15:11,487 --> 03:15:13,791
What is that doing there

1566
03:15:14,047 --> 03:15:18,655
Why did it switch from 41 4853 to the codes

1567
03:15:19,167 --> 03:15:20,191
With

1568
03:15:21,215 --> 03:15:22,239
With that

1569
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:27,615
Maybe it's a different ways in which they can index the

1570
03:16:00,895 --> 03:16:03,199
Oh my gosh

1571
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:27,519
I do appreciate that you're trying to reverse-engineer it

1572
03:16:28,287 --> 03:16:30,847
I mean you never know if

1573
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:32,639
If if

1574
03:16:35,199 --> 03:16:39,039
If if Ben is not feeling particularly

1575
03:16:40,063 --> 03:16:42,367
Charitable and

1576
03:16:42,623 --> 03:16:47,743
I'm in we can't get it then we might have to resort to it

1577
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:54,655
Oh I don't want Ben to tell us if he plans to tell us eventually if we don't get it

1578
03:17:16,159 --> 03:17:19,487
So weird

1579
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:23,583
53

1580
03:17:27,423 --> 03:17:31,519
Following is in reference to

1581
03:17:35,359 --> 03:17:38,175
Iran Twitter

1582
03:17:47,903 --> 03:17:54,047
Just for the sake of having this as a

1583
03:17:54,303 --> 03:18:00,447
Do I have permission to post the the text file that you provided like you're not you

1584
03:18:00,703 --> 03:18:06,847
Provide a bit like these tidbits of conversation in the in the

1585
03:18:07,103 --> 03:18:11,455
Just that I'm going to be having cuz I don't remember all of this

1586
03:18:23,999 --> 03:18:25,023
Oh

1587
03:18:25,279 --> 03:18:28,607
Wait a minute then are you telling me that you

1588
03:18:29,887 --> 03:18:33,727
But you did the compression in the fpga

1589
03:18:36,543 --> 03:18:37,055
Cuz

1590
03:18:37,311 --> 03:18:37,823
That's

1591
03:18:38,847 --> 03:18:40,383
That's insane

1592
03:18:42,687 --> 03:18:48,831
I am okay with using fpgas is glorified shift registers and capture compare but

1593
03:18:49,087 --> 03:18:49,599
Really

1594
03:19:43,103 --> 03:19:49,247
What

1595
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:41,023
Oh that band that makes it sense with the

1596
03:22:42,047 --> 03:22:48,191
Why be reverse-engineered also quickly because when I plug it in to the USB it gives didn't

1597
03:22:48,447 --> 03:22:54,591
Simple format where is why I have it on Eric is it in the Ludacris

1598
03:22:54,847 --> 03:22:56,127
Allocated format

1599
03:23:23,007 --> 03:23:29,151
Can I ask you guys something right now and I hope you'll tell me this

1600
03:23:29,407 --> 03:23:35,551
Is everything we're doing right now all going to be for not because you're going to drop some firmware update in that's going

1601
03:23:35,807 --> 03:23:41,951
I completely lock us out

1602
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:48,351
Statement there scares me

1603
03:24:39,551 --> 03:24:45,695
Decoding that number in

1604
03:24:45,951 --> 03:24:52,095
Incorrectly anything

1605
03:24:52,351 --> 03:24:58,495
SP2 coating that number incorrectly

1606
03:25:53,535 --> 03:25:59,679
No0 f49 F4

1607
03:25:59,935 --> 03:26:06,079
Siam to coating that according to the rules

1608
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:13,247
It's very strange. That doesn't line up to anything

1609
03:26:32,191 --> 03:26:35,775
Well we're not going to try to lock you out

1610
03:26:39,871 --> 03:26:46,015
But we're going to add features someday that will break this without caring that it will break you

1611
03:26:46,271 --> 03:26:52,415
So glad you guys care the good news

1612
03:26:52,671 --> 03:26:58,815
I only need this to work for my project for a little while three months

1613
03:26:59,071 --> 03:27:05,215
Moved on and working on a different thing then

1614
03:27:05,471 --> 03:27:11,615
Everybody else who wants to use this though they're going to be very sad

1615
03:27:37,215 --> 03:27:43,359
But I don't need to do my wireless protocol I I have my own I'm going to be

1616
03:27:49,247 --> 03:27:55,391
The same as I've been doing on like the 3D localization video and a bunch of other other things being able to

1617
03:27:55,647 --> 03:27:59,231
Faster sampling rate

1618
03:28:01,791 --> 03:28:07,935
Oh different Harbor okay yeah sure I get that fine you're going to change that because the different Hardware I'm I am

1619
03:28:08,191 --> 03:28:14,335
A okay with that if somebody else wants to use their Vibe with my system they're going to have to go do this reverse engineering

1620
03:28:14,591 --> 03:28:17,151
Themself

1621
03:28:23,295 --> 03:28:29,439
I don't really want to go too much into what my particular project is for them but it's

1622
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:36,095
A whole lot of steps to get somewhere that's not actually that cool but I think it's going to be much more the adventure

1623
03:28:36,351 --> 03:28:42,495
Aaron trying to get where I want to be we really need to figure this out guys like

1624
03:28:42,751 --> 03:28:48,127
This thing here what is up with these B why is this particular field so high

1625
03:28:48,383 --> 03:28:51,711
Like what is going on there

1626
03:28:51,967 --> 03:28:58,111
But I just checked and yeah like yeah actually decoding that right

1627
03:29:00,159 --> 03:29:02,207
I think

1628
03:29:02,463 --> 03:29:05,279
Yeah I guess I can put into calcaneal say

1629
03:29:52,383 --> 03:29:58,527
Yeah I'm decoding it according to the rules Corral

1630
03:29:58,783 --> 03:30:04,927
Broccoli looks like

1631
03:30:15,167 --> 03:30:21,311
Yeah I really like that idea of having the extra I love you not saying how many parameters there are

1632
03:30:21,567 --> 03:30:25,663
But knowing how many there are based off of the field that is

1633
03:30:25,919 --> 03:30:27,711
That's pretty cool

1634
03:30:33,343 --> 03:30:34,879
Anyway

1635
03:30:35,647 --> 03:30:41,791
Guys do we have any idea when I moved from 70 microseconds to 80

1636
03:30:42,047 --> 03:30:47,167
Not microseconds 80 time units

1637
03:31:03,807 --> 03:31:08,159
I just realized something dumb I think I'm sending this thing out at 4 MHz

1638
03:31:09,951 --> 03:31:14,303
Not 1.8 whatever

1639
03:31:15,839 --> 03:31:19,935
Note MP4 MHz caviar is running too slow

1640
03:31:29,151 --> 03:31:35,295
The number is right here but the problem is that the number is

1641
03:31:35,551 --> 03:31:38,111
Call kind of stacks together

1642
03:31:42,207 --> 03:31:46,559
And there's like no good split at the 16th Mark or anything like that

1643
03:31:49,375 --> 03:31:55,519
Like if I do - 262144 as what's-his-name suggest

1644
03:31:55,775 --> 03:31:57,823
My gosh is a negative number

1645
03:32:05,503 --> 03:32:10,623
Why did I not think to try that

1646
03:32:10,879 --> 03:32:12,927
Oh my gosh

1647
03:32:21,631 --> 03:32:25,727
Okay let's do that now what

1648
03:32:30,335 --> 03:32:33,663
Found something new

1649
03:32:49,279 --> 03:32:54,655
You could have negative time Delta's

1650
03:32:54,911 --> 03:32:57,215
That is weird

1651
03:33:02,335 --> 03:33:07,967
Although that number doesn't make any sense

1652
03:33:08,479 --> 03:33:14,111
That number is way too big so big

1653
03:33:15,647 --> 03:33:17,695
I can't be the right number

1654
03:33:17,951 --> 03:33:21,279
Cuz that would be too big

1655
03:33:22,559 --> 03:33:24,095
Pat V

1656
03:33:25,375 --> 03:33:28,191
Boop

1657
03:33:28,959 --> 03:33:35,103
Took that long has toothless 3 or 10

1658
03:33:37,407 --> 03:33:41,247
38 + 50 +

1659
03:33:42,271 --> 03:33:46,367
I know it's not 10:00

1660
03:33:47,903 --> 03:33:49,695
* 10

1661
03:33:59,679 --> 03:34:01,727
Yeah that's way too big

1662
03:34:03,519 --> 03:34:05,311
Nevermind

1663
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:13,759
What is the significance of it being negative

1664
03:34:26,047 --> 03:34:28,863
My delay between batches is a very long time

1665
03:34:49,855 --> 03:34:52,415
And how is it

1666
03:35:11,103 --> 03:35:14,943
Compass not negative

1667
03:35:21,087 --> 03:35:26,463
Okay well so like look if I don't do negative here

1668
03:35:26,975 --> 03:35:33,119
That this number right here like I look at it I have ones and zeroes like

1669
03:35:33,375 --> 03:35:39,519
Pretty evenly strewn all throughout the number I can really think of is maybe it's like

1670
03:35:41,055 --> 03:35:47,199
I don't even know a complete mess of ones and zeros there's no

1671
03:35:50,271 --> 03:35:56,415
Not to look here

1672
03:35:56,671 --> 03:36:02,815
But I don't get it otherwise it's a messed up of ones and

1673
03:36:03,071 --> 03:36:09,215
Gyros

1674
03:36:22,271 --> 03:36:28,415
I'll look up what the delay between the two packages

1675
03:36:28,671 --> 03:36:34,815
It 10 ms between packets

1676
03:36:41,471 --> 03:36:47,615
I already did figure out it if you

1677
03:36:47,871 --> 03:36:54,015
Trip if you want go look at the gist I have at the bottom of the just one packet where it doesn't update and one pack at work does

1678
03:36:54,271 --> 03:37:00,415
Does trigger

1679
03:37:00,671 --> 03:37:06,815
Jeremy

1680
03:37:07,071 --> 03:37:13,215
That again

1681
03:37:13,471 --> 03:37:19,615
I I did see that

1682
03:37:19,871 --> 03:37:26,015
But I still don't understand how to be a positive number unless it's like the actual time shifted over

1683
03:37:26,271 --> 03:37:32,415
Oh that's exact number

1684
03:37:32,671 --> 03:37:38,815
All your following we will be

1685
03:38:02,111 --> 03:38:07,487
If you want to know more precisely

1686
03:38:20,543 --> 03:38:26,687
Somewhere here

1687
03:38:33,343 --> 03:38:39,487
You called Arcane pop and honor of been calling this type of compression Arcane compress

1688
03:38:39,743 --> 03:38:45,887
I can survive underscore data. See

1689
03:38:52,543 --> 03:38:58,687
Oh yeah bad whenever you get back or if his back now already it was 10

1690
03:38:58,943 --> 03:39:05,087
Ms between packets

1691
03:39:05,343 --> 03:39:11,487
Yeah it's not normal but I don't think it matters does it mean I guess we can test that will test it how about that

1692
03:39:11,743 --> 03:39:17,887
So now it's 26 some big number I don't even know

1693
03:39:18,143 --> 03:39:24,287
Let's go increase it to 11 MS

1694
03:39:24,543 --> 03:39:30,687
Oh it is why does that matter

1695
03:39:30,943 --> 03:39:37,087
Why does that number change based on the can light

1696
03:39:37,343 --> 03:39:42,719
Difference what do you know that I don't trip what do you know that I don't

1697
03:39:46,303 --> 03:39:51,423
Why

1698
03:39:51,679 --> 03:39:57,823
Hahaha

1699
03:40:05,247 --> 03:40:11,391
No

1700
03:40:54,143 --> 03:41:00,287
Oh yeah you're right it probably isn't

1701
03:41:00,543 --> 03:41:02,079
11 milliseconds

1702
03:41:08,735 --> 03:41:12,319
Why

1703
03:41:12,575 --> 03:41:18,207
Why

1704
03:42:10,687 --> 03:42:16,831
No it is getting a little bit of a DVR clock is totally it's not

1705
03:42:17,087 --> 03:42:23,231
I don't really know what it is I didn't even bother thinking about it but as he pointed out we can't calculate it now

1706
03:42:23,487 --> 03:42:27,071
It would be

1707
03:42:27,583 --> 03:42:29,375
He says

1708
03:42:29,631 --> 03:42:35,775
280,000 actually would be better for me to use the other number since it rounds to 10 nicely

1709
03:42:42,687 --> 03:42:46,015
How did he recommend of-40 86

1710
03:42:50,111 --> 03:42:52,415
Five Point

1711
03:43:00,607 --> 03:43:04,191
Why is the AVR clock higher

1712
03:43:04,447 --> 03:43:06,751
I thought the Aviary was clocked lower

1713
03:43:26,207 --> 03:43:32,351
Help oh well I guess DVR clock Tire it is actually operating it like that other frequency the 44

1714
03:43:32,607 --> 03:43:38,751
MHz inside the 1.8 I don't know whenever

1715
03:43:39,007 --> 03:43:41,567
Enable the PLL

1716
03:43:41,823 --> 03:43:45,151
No

1717
03:43:46,431 --> 03:43:50,271
I never able to PLL it shouldn't be that high

1718
03:43:51,551 --> 03:43:57,695
That's totally wrong though so whatever I was going to comment that out delete it

1719
03:43:59,231 --> 03:44:03,071
Okay so

1720
03:44:03,327 --> 03:44:06,655
A 5.3 mean 5.8 Ms Right

1721
03:44:09,215 --> 03:44:12,287
Let's pretend

1722
03:44:12,543 --> 03:44:15,871
So if you want to divide that by

1723
03:44:29,439 --> 03:44:33,535
Yay yay come out it's not about

1724
03:44:45,823 --> 03:44:51,967
Santa's enjoying all the controllers acting is logic analyzer for finding bugs and reverse engineering

1725
03:45:04,511 --> 03:45:05,535
Kevin called it

1726
03:45:05,791 --> 03:45:06,815
That is true

1727
03:45:09,375 --> 03:45:15,519
I really wish you guys all the people who are watching right now had

1728
03:45:18,079 --> 03:45:21,151
Had one of these to play around at home with

1729
03:45:29,599 --> 03:45:35,743
By the way you guys have Vibes and you're not doing this right now

1730
03:45:52,127 --> 03:45:58,271
I just said it to like the 16 Ms time why is this

1731
03:45:58,783 --> 03:46:04,927
It shouldn't just be giving up eventually

1732
03:46:09,535 --> 03:46:15,679
15.4 okay fine I'll go a little bit longer

1733
03:46:17,983 --> 03:46:24,127
What is the point in having something only

1734
03:46:24,383 --> 03:46:26,943
Why

1735
03:46:28,479 --> 03:46:33,855
What's 17 Ms why are you still holding onto the data

1736
03:46:34,367 --> 03:46:36,415
Like

1737
03:46:38,975 --> 03:46:42,303
Why

1738
03:47:06,367 --> 03:47:10,719
Georgia Sally Mac Westport

1739
03:47:15,583 --> 03:47:20,447
George are you adding it's alive vibralife survive

1740
03:47:20,703 --> 03:47:26,847
Okay that's cool thank you George

1741
03:47:27,103 --> 03:47:33,247
Specifically David Chapman the guy who's doing the other work on this has a lot of interest in doing okay

1742
03:47:33,503 --> 03:47:38,111
Opengl windows and see until like he has a solution right now but

1743
03:47:38,367 --> 03:47:44,511
I'm printing a good weight if you can send me a personal message with your email so I can hook you up

1744
03:47:44,767 --> 03:47:50,911
You up with David Chapman I think that would work out really good cuz he's a dad who likes using OS X

1745
03:47:57,567 --> 03:48:01,663
Dakota around line 57 and isn't correct

1746
03:48:03,967 --> 03:48:10,111
So different from real data that you're seeing strangeness but the finger decoding

1747
03:48:12,671 --> 03:48:14,207
57

1748
03:48:29,311 --> 03:48:33,663
I didn't even think to look at that

1749
03:48:39,039 --> 03:48:43,135
Pretty much too tired now though to make any changes that would be significant

1750
03:50:05,055 --> 03:50:11,199
No I know your coding is representing reality because like it's a linear transform in

1751
03:50:11,455 --> 03:50:17,599
Somehow the Aviary just clocked that high like I get it there is a famous quote which is

1752
03:50:18,623 --> 03:50:24,767
99.9% of all Aviary uark problems are actually clocking problems

1753
03:50:30,655 --> 03:50:36,799
And Akai the other thing is once the system once I can handle the

1754
03:50:37,055 --> 03:50:43,199
Data from this I'm totally going to just go fire up the lighthouses and see if I get David at 3

1755
03:50:43,455 --> 03:50:49,599
Go back cuz I do have the the main headset dealing with the data on that way

1756
03:50:52,671 --> 03:50:58,815
Make text Jay would probably explode mychelle why would it explode my shell

1757
03:50:59,071 --> 03:51:05,215
Oh okay

1758
03:51:05,471 --> 03:51:11,615
Don't even know what to check anymore

1759
03:51:13,151 --> 03:51:19,295
I don't even know what the change like at this point I'm so lost this going to take

1760
03:51:19,551 --> 03:51:25,695
Thinking and looking at numbers and it's already 12:12 which is getting really close to my stop time

1761
03:51:33,375 --> 03:51:39,519
Oh haha you were going to have somebody copy and paste the backslash make Dash J

1762
03:51:39,775 --> 03:51:41,567
Yeah that would explode

1763
03:51:45,407 --> 03:51:48,479
Do I have any man though

1764
03:51:51,551 --> 03:51:53,599
I don't see anything

1765
03:52:05,375 --> 03:52:10,239
Do you say line 357

1766
03:52:26,111 --> 03:52:32,255
And I wish I had thought about this earlier we could have had like an official recorder somebody who is

1767
03:52:32,511 --> 03:52:38,655
Is actually like tasked with like taking notes

1768
03:52:44,799 --> 03:52:49,151
Turn around her what was the thing somebody said got it where is the other it is

1769
03:52:49,407 --> 03:52:55,551
PK Tuesday which I've already forgotten his actual name I don't know how I forgotten cuz I slept up in

1770
03:52:55,807 --> 03:52:57,599
Twitter Alan Yates

1771
03:52:57,855 --> 03:53:01,183
Alan Gates

1772
03:53:07,327 --> 03:53:13,471
Oh my gosh if I can get people playing with live survive I would love to have some extra eyes on that

1773
03:53:13,727 --> 03:53:19,871
Had to really get that fleshed out so I don't have to deal with all of the stupid bugs in it myself

1774
03:53:23,967 --> 03:53:30,111
I really don't even know what to change to do this right this thing parameter is par place to Delta

1775
03:53:32,415 --> 03:53:38,559
No I know it's wrong now but I'm still trying to figure out what the the correct thing is

1776
03:53:38,815 --> 03:53:41,375
So like this here

1777
03:53:42,911 --> 03:53:48,031
I'll actually know what I can do we can use the prime thing again

1778
03:54:25,663 --> 03:54:31,807
Do whatever that limit is will you just now found out we can flirt with it I don't know if you guys care

1779
03:54:32,063 --> 03:54:35,135
I think it's a little weird that it's

1780
03:54:35,391 --> 03:54:37,183
Watering

1781
03:54:40,511 --> 03:54:46,655
Maybe I'll just copy that just in case

1782
03:56:04,991 --> 03:56:10,367
How you're having problems with Watchman command codes

1783
03:56:14,207 --> 03:56:17,535
No I have a day job

1784
03:56:19,839 --> 03:56:25,983
I just spend a great deal of time making my projects in working on making YouTube

1785
03:56:26,239 --> 03:56:31,871
Videos nobody could be a professional the YouTuber 20K Subs would take like

1786
03:56:32,383 --> 03:56:38,527
I know it easily take 500,000 Subs before you could really make it a professional job

1787
03:56:42,111 --> 03:56:45,183
Unknown Watchman code 32

1788
03:56:45,439 --> 03:56:51,583
Oh that's really weird

1789
03:56:58,239 --> 03:57:04,383
Tudu tudu tudu I'm going to close the Stream

1790
03:57:04,639 --> 03:57:10,783
But look at these values and try to

1791
03:57:11,039 --> 03:57:17,183
To figure out what's wrong with the Delta a Delta

1792
03:57:17,439 --> 03:57:21,535
Beko din

1793
03:57:22,047 --> 03:57:24,095
Survive

1794
03:57:24,351 --> 03:57:26,399
Data. See

1795
03:57:26,655 --> 03:57:31,007
Does anybody have any further notes that

1796
03:57:37,663 --> 03:57:43,807
Yeah I do have a patreon if you guys do on a straight-up do at the patrons more for individual projects though

1797
03:57:44,063 --> 03:57:50,207
I'm so something like this would not fit into the patreon

1798
03:58:00,447 --> 03:58:06,591
So let's just say we're going to stop like actual Deming for tonight I taken all the

1799
03:58:06,847 --> 03:58:07,615
What date I'm going to take

1800
03:58:08,383 --> 03:58:10,687
I'm going to commit what I have here

1801
03:58:56,767 --> 03:59:00,863
Okay any other notes that

1802
03:59:01,119 --> 03:59:07,263
Yeah I know it looks like to field mashed together but we are pretty sure that it is the amount of time between the two frame

1803
03:59:07,519 --> 03:59:08,031
Games

1804
03:59:15,199 --> 03:59:21,343
So no actually that was covered a little bit earlier Ryan the the the numbers that

1805
03:59:21,599 --> 03:59:27,743
There are reflecting reality in that regard I'm a pretty sure that's what they had indicated in when I change

1806
03:59:27,999 --> 03:59:34,143
Change the delay between the the packets or whatever ignifica Nelly

1807
03:59:34,399 --> 03:59:39,007
Really is that like a 17 milliseconds or whatever between sending the

1808
03:59:39,519 --> 03:59:40,287
The messages

1809
03:59:49,759 --> 03:59:53,855
I hope I've gotten at least a couple other people interested maybe

1810
03:59:54,111 --> 03:59:59,231
Maybe some of you guys are going to go download live survive on Lenox Heroes X and

1811
03:59:59,487 --> 04:00:05,631
Push push

1812
04:00:05,887 --> 04:00:12,031
Support

1813
04:00:12,287 --> 04:00:18,431
I've stuff and once this is solved I'll start doing more development on the side that I need to in order to get to the price

1814
04:00:18,687 --> 04:00:19,711
Trying to get to

1815
04:00:22,783 --> 04:00:28,927
Anything else before we go anything you guys can think of it you really want to see I like some combination of

1816
04:00:29,183 --> 04:00:31,487
Have lights on and off or anything like that

1817
04:01:14,239 --> 04:01:18,591
I really don't want to get into the final goal

1818
04:01:19,103 --> 04:01:20,383
It is

1819
04:01:20,895 --> 04:01:27,039
It is really lost Ian I don't really want to find out for something I don't think I'm going to be able to succeed

1820
04:01:28,319 --> 04:01:28,831
Yeah

1821
04:01:29,855 --> 04:01:34,463
For some sort of specific reason having to do with

1822
04:01:37,535 --> 04:01:43,679
I'd be willing to talk it over with with specifically developed as offline. What I'm trying to do

1823
04:01:43,935 --> 04:01:44,447
But

1824
04:01:44,959 --> 04:01:47,775
I don't want my

1825
04:01:49,055 --> 04:01:50,847
Gold two

1826
04:01:51,871 --> 04:01:58,015
Really want to dig into that.

1827
04:01:58,271 --> 04:02:04,415
I have used in the past but it would take the device

1828
04:02:04,671 --> 04:02:05,183
Filter

1829
04:02:05,439 --> 04:02:08,511
So that you could talk to all the 5 pieces of hardware

1830
04:02:08,767 --> 04:02:13,631
We could probably mess up the drivers for use with the valve stuff

1831
04:02:13,887 --> 04:02:20,031
And so it would be complete pain you have to keep going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth I'm disabling all the

1832
04:02:20,287 --> 04:02:25,663
All the drivers re-enabling them so that you can use your your Vive with steam

1833
04:02:26,175 --> 04:02:27,711
Instead of Life survive

You can direct message people on Twitter
