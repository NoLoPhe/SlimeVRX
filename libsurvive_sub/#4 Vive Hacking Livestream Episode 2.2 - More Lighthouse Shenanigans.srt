00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay hey everybody Welcome to the fourth live stream of me hacking

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Well not just me but all you guys hacking the the HTC Vive

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
PNC we were a little bit of that is true

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
We've been doing over the last couple times is we had been trying to well first of all get access to the watch

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
Fan controller be able to read the the times coming off of that then it worked after

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
A bunch of help from Ben and the rest of the guys over at valve I feel kind of a fairly reverse-engineering when you get there

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Map of the company who made it and we've been trying to figure out the position of the lighthouses they

8
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Based on this position of the of the headset

9
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,344
Stop about the factory config much much thanks to then

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
And HTC is apparently HTC did keep a copy of my key

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Configuration so I was able to actually get that copy of the configuration

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
And put it back on the headset and it tracks just fine

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
Looks like it worked and on top of that I did actually get the new positions

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Normals of my headset up on up on to get Hub thing so if you

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
He go to the GitHub

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
What is it the table live survive Issue Number 3

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
You can actually see that yes then came through with the email to HTC and

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Nhtc did have the the my configuration still there so that's really good

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Good news if you want to get the points that were operating with you can totally get that and

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
And see if I can get the normals somewhere here

21
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
I also took the normal for my headset which I found out is kind of important

22
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
I have a my program totally did not work

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
Work that well it was telling me like lighthouses will be under the floor and all this other stuff until I started taking into consideration

24
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
The normals and what I did with the normals was

25
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
Draw little thing here

26
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
If I have a

27
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
If I had a a camera position that I was going to try to go to and so say for whatever

28
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Reason my algorithm thought the camera was down here even though the sensor has a normal pointing up that way

29
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Because the cameras behind the normal of the sensor I can now no that's not it that's not

30
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Not a good tracking point because there's no way for this Lighthouse be able to cast a ray

31
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
Onto the sensor for the sensor to see it if the sensors pointing the wrong way I'm so soon as I did that

32
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
I was able to resolve much better the where where I thought the lighthouses

33
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
Today some of the things I really wanted to dig into this time

34
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
Or I wanted to find out first of all from you guys if anyone in chat

35
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Nose forget a copy of the the positions and normals from the

36
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
From the from the Watchmen so with that is

37
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
On these controllers right here I want to know

38
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
If anybody knows where to get a copy of the thing I think I saw it online somewhere but I just don't know where

39
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
But the thing that says where the location of all of these points are and their normals, now come

40
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
And really helpful I think because for my algorithm if I just have the Vive and I'm trying to figure out the positions

41
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
The fall of the lighthouses based on only the Vive it's kind of hard because there's about a maybe

42
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
Get two or three DM area easily two or three decimals about 2 or 3 DM

43
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Really can't figure out where exactly the lighthouses within so

44
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
First bring up that program and I'll run

45
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:42,111
Make sure I can run it I didn't even have not tried yet on this this user account

46
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
Under Tools clean test to make

47
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
Correct

48
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
HMV points

49
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,807
You guys want to see this how you guys can play along with this tool I did post the files in the issue so

50
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,855
So I'm going to go download them

51
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
So correct H&B points the next one is hmd

52
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Normals can I go download that

53
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
And that's downloaded what's the last one test 5 was I actually already on test 5

54
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
I don't know all I have is test for

55
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,503
She's at the last one I posted I guess we'll use test for

56
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023
Fixed your cursor how did you get it it's a totally different setting that was not highlight

57
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
It changed it definitely does not highlight only the things that you've changed it was use local kersal

58
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
Use local cursor is false so you guys know that use local cursor equals

59
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
Apparently it's the thing another option I don't remember what flags I passed this

60
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
I'll see if I can

61
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
So this when I say x 11 TNC no x no X damage Quaker mode show cursor

62
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
So this is the plan that I use for my client

63
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
The fact what you missed was the fact that we spent the first 15 minutes the livestream trying to figure out how to show the

64
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
The cursor on the actual live streams that was a little bit embarrassing

65
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
Yeah back to work now though are you

66
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
You guys in chat able to monitor seeing what's happening

67
00:06:53,951 --> 00:07:00,095
Brandon okay

68
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
From test 5:05 I mistyped that test

69
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
4K can't open to lighthouses test data

70
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
That really

71
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
Can't open

72
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
20 test four

73
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,511
Four. CSV what did I miss type

74
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
Charleston modified shootout the screen to the hackerspace bombers you absolutely should pass the stream out to anybody

75
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
What do you think of

76
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
See that looks like a reasonable answer so

77
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
What is programmed as right now I guess I should go over kind of an overview of how I decided to tackle the problem

78
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,975
And let you guys know that the the problem

79
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Dissolution doesn't really work out as well as I thought it would explain why I think that's the case

80
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
And we'll talk a little bit about some of the things that we can do to try to make it a little bit better so

81
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,383
I have a see if I can get this

82
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,039
Have some way of holding this here

83
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,695
There anything rated you can find for me hey give me a board game box

84
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
Accomplishing counter

85
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,727
I don't have any good oscilloscope splitting around downstairs today

86
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
Do you know who we will be explaining this lighthouse

87
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
Thing on the game of life here okay anyway

88
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
So what I had set off was I had the the

89
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
The system setup where I had the head-mounted display with all of its wonderful photodiodes on it and I

90
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
I have two lighthouses

91
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
Now for those of you I know somebody said Lighthouse? Lighthouses are

92
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
The funny black boxes that come with the buy system that just fits emit infrared out into the sea

93
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
So what they actually do with Phil sweep laser this way on one axis and

94
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
I'll sweep it this way on the other access and it's creating a plane of a laser-like swooping down but between

95
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
Those two I can have an imaginary point that comes out from the lighthouse into a point on the

96
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Into the appoint on the heads mouth display I have a magic wand that comes out of this and go through it

97
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Point on the head-mounted display so what I wanted to do was I want to find the the lighthouses

98
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
In a coordinate frame that starts in the center of the the bad mouth display so

99
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
You can actually have a shot at seeing that

100
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
That's only awkward but

101
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Rrr

102
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Center is located and we're going to figure out where the lighthouse

103
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
Houses are relative to that I'm so my first approach was to take these cameras and then moved

104
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
Everywhere in 3D space just everywhere everywhere I can think of and then

105
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,951
Or eat them in all sorts of random directions until I found a direction that kind of work

106
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
This is really terrible

107
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
This is

108
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
Really

109
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Really terrible because you have to search in Six Dimensions because there's six degrees of freedom

110
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
And that takes a while it worked but it took quite a while into that was terrible so then the next thing I

111
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
I did was I decided to start using some linear algebra so I can try the Cameron all these different locations and then

112
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
Use the magic of linear algebra to get the camera to point at the head-mounted display and then I will go

113
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
Go through each of the different photodiodes that were visible to the camera and figure out well how off would it be if the camera was right

114
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Right here

115
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
So that worked a lot better but I can't seem to reliably get

116
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
Get the position of the of the lighthouses all that accurate

117
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
That reliably so let's let's first start bye weeks play

118
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
Playing what it was like how if I if I say lighthouses here and I want to point it at the head-mounted splay and

119
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
I haven't oriented so

120
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,887
From the lighthouses point of view it's going to be pointed off in the middle of nowhere land so

121
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,287
The first we have to get the lighthouse here to point at the head-mounted display

122
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
The way that we actually do that is through the magic of some aqua turn Ian's here and

123
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
What I mean is I right now if I'm a lighthouse start on a new page here

124
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
Find the lighthouse I'm pointed up by default like I'm just going to say this direction is Plus

125
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
The terrible drawing there and

126
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,519
What I'm going to try those I have a head not display down here

127
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
All these little dots on it and I want to be able to find out how would I have to rotate the lighthouse

128
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:39,295
Get it the point over there and what I can do is I can draw than imaginary Ray

129
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
That's going in the direction that this thing thinks it sees a light and I'm going to draw an imaginary race

130
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
From where this Lighthouse is to the point that it should be intersecting and then what I can do

131
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
If I can take the cross product of these two factors and that will give me an Access and in this case

132
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
Out of the page so it'll give me an axis to rotate about which is out of the page and

133
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
But I can do is I can take that's the cross product cross

134
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Cross product and then I can find out how much it needs to

135
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,791
Rotate find out this angle here by using the.

136
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Product

137
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
Now by using these two things I can help point the head-mounted display at the at the story

138
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
The Lighthouse at the head-mounted display so what I ended up getting is something where would have

139
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
Effectively show a bunch of dots for the head-mounted display and a bunch of God Square

140
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
It's thought they would be but they would be oriented all wrong and so I have to buy the way

141
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
The point I was pointing out is now dead on but now I have to go rotated a bunch more and rotated around

142
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,751
And try to get it to the where is pointed and that access is exactly where it would need to be pointed

143
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
Based on that location that is currently at in this this worked actually relatively

144
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
Well and was relatively fast and in fact I guess I should run it

145
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,951
And show you guys with some of this looks like so at the end of the program

146
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
Right here I have the output and so what this shows is the position that the

147
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
He'd had mouth display was actually in and the position in imagespace that we think we were pointing at

148
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:41,151
So nice from the point of view of the

149
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
Of the camera calc

150
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,951
I'm just paste it in here

151
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
And I'm going to grab this so I'm going to show you guys so this is from what

152
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
My thing thinks the best location is and so what for

153
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
That's some of the points on a head-mounted display and you can see they the point actually kind of line up to what the head-mounted

154
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,551
Play really is I'm so if you look here you can see based on this it is getting better

155
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,951
It is getting some of the points on one of the sides of the head Mount display so that's what those are

156
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,351
And then fix my access a little bit here

157
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
.004 okay then I cannot

158
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
Also show the other data range so let's add new column here x-values

159
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
Film y values hoops

160
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
My values boom okay and so now we can see that

161
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
Where the camera where the watch where the lighthouse

162
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
From their point of view again the lighthouse has no way of seeing anything but it does have a point of view from its point of view

163
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
The the red dots are where it thinks it sees the the dots on the vine

164
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
Pfizer and the blue dots are where they should be so we can see here the lighthouse in the visor

165
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,951
Kind of lined up but really not that well and there's this one point that's just off in the middle of nowhere land

166
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
And we can look at it from the other lighthouses point of view as well so right

167
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
Now I'm looking at the El Lighthouse which is the one that's closest to me the one up there I'm going to nail look at the

168
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
The our Lighthouse take a look at that one save

169
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Ron

170
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
So now from the right Lifehouse is point of view

171
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,975
Oh I do I delete that area see that again

172
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
And we're going to fix our

173
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
Are axis so that we can actually see everything so now this

174
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Blinds up extremely well have a fairly High degree of confidence that it figured out where the lighthouse was pretty well

175
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Now the only problem is that because the

176
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
Angle is so narrow on because from the lighthouses point of view the

177
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
The the the thing though the head melt display so we have a lighthouse

178
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,775
Over here and it's looking out into my my living room floor

179
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,639
I've had male display over here with some sensors on it from this thing's point-of-view

180
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
That's a really long way away and those are very very tightly placed so

181
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,439
All of those those dots right there are very very tightly coupled so

182
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,839
If it's looking to Target on that one and it thinks it's it's whizzing by like that it's pretty good

183
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
But you know this thing could be moving in or out by 5 easily decimeters

184
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
I would have no idea so that's one place where this algorithm is definitely coming up short

185
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
But other than that it seems like it's getting at least a rough estimate so I don't know

186
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Exactly how we're going to solve this yet but I would imagine some of it might have to do with using the

187
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
The Watchdog controllers here and here to somewhere else so they

188
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:50,239
That you can have a wider range in order to calibrate based on the only problem is we don't know where these

189
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
These controllers are so we would have to look at it from to Lighthouse Point of View and

190
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
By doing that maybe will be able to resolve a little bit better figure out exactly

191
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
See what's really going on there and I've been pretty much straight through anybody

192
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,839
Can't you just get the time between the sensors or

193
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
Hit by The Sweep since you know the sweep speed calculate angle

194
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,639
Nissan The Sweep time the sweep speed from this Lighthouse is point of view

195
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
What angle it sat for the head-mounted display right there

196
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
So, things that I really wanted to approach

197
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
I don't know if anybody keeps track of like my Twitter or anything but my recent post

198
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Twitter has exactly to do with this project let me go close the cap on this

199
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
Okay

200
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,759
Cyclone asked if you're taking averages of the data

201
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
Oh yeah so spell balloon

202
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,559
Wanted to know if I was taking averages of of all of the data and the way I did it was I just ran for life

203
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
Like 10 seconds and took the entire thing as an average I'm just just the whole thing average it together

204
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:31,359
Weather and that's where we're going to be considered PowerPoint so it was able to resolve the angles pretty tightly

205
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
So the one thing I wanted to mention was this right here

206
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Is is part of my voxatron or sorry box

207
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,511
Plastic right now

208
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
Download github iOS

209
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
Boxel Pathak okay so one of the problems that I ran into is I needed a way of visualizing

210
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
In 3D space How likely it was that anyone of the

211
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
That I might have the camera right and so I have a level of confidence if those. Do not line up with

212
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
Where I think the photodiodes Arthur's raise don't line up but I know the camera's not there but maybe it's better in some

213
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Maybe it's better than others maybe there's local minimums and local maximums maybe the global minimum and global

214
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
Maximum Global minimum are the same as all the local which case we

215
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,512
We can do a lot of things to speed it up right now all I'm doing some searching through all the points until I finally

216
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Looks really good I'll just go use that one and then just go a little bit around there and search more than

217
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
Until now I've never been able to really visualize that data so

218
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
So this right here is the the Wi-Fi visualizing Wi-Fi videos

219
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:18,112
This this area right here isn't about a 1.3 by 14 sorry .3 by .38 18

220
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
M space the amount that Wi-Fi signal is up and down and these notes

221
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
Static and there's a whole video about that just check up on the Wi-Fi VDOT was not seeing that this is some really cool

222
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:37,312
. point is since I made this video JavaScript now has a file API so I

223
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:43,712
I can load my own file into this to visualize so I'm going to be trying to Output

224
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
3D file so I can take a look at the probabilities of How likely it is

225
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
Is that the White House is in any one location so let's go do that right now so party

226
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,912
Camfind here I go through and have a whole bunch of print apps to get someone else to clean some of that off

227
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
Where do I buy don't I don't have to do that but I will do

228
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
I will make it so I have a first-run if I could just do it on cycle number and

229
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,296
Splits

230
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
Let me make sure that this actually works out to the right number of of everything

231
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
So what I'm doing right now is I'm just going to try to make sure that

232
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
That when I'm searching the space the the area in which I want to see how likely it is that the lighthouses in any give

233
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
Given location I'm printing out the number of points in that space I'm looking at

234
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,912
And I need to make sure that it is something with the power of two edges so voxel tastic

235
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
It can only display data if it's exactly power of two sizes so if I

236
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,712
I have 423 pixels wide there's no way I can display that data but if I have 64

237
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
4 pixels wide Good2Go 128 probably

238
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:32,512
Do non power of two so we're going to have to make sure that we search a power of

239
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
Two space-time switch this to I don't know 32 pixels wide and see how they

240
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
Alekos

241
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
Set X Y and Z on a see if that works out correctly

242
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Okay so it thinks it had 139,000 something that is not a power of 2

243
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
See here if I get rid of the less than or equal to

244
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,704
131072 that is a power of two

245
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,104
See make sure that that's right that would be I think 64 by 6

246
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,504
54 by 32 131072

247
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Do we have a power of two points that we can investigate so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a file

248
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,304
Files to RF equals who actually better yet

249
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
If cycle = 0 ft

250
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,104
Equals F open Raw

251
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
Data lighthouse.

252
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,904
Yes voxel Pathak only take some straight raw files

253
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
Can actually do red green blue flyq have for things or it'll just do it heatmap if you only have one so right now we're

254
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,704
Visualizing one lighthouses position in 3D space so let's see what that looks like so

255
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,104
Cycle of 0f open all that jazz then once for every single.

256
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,504
We're going to go display it out what it is at that that space so I'm going to say

257
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
We don't need that sells thing anymore

258
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:45,120
For this particular location I have the Ft which is the quality

259
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
If cycle

260
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:57,920
I don't have is I don't know what the range on this really

261
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
Should day

262
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:17,120
Let's make it so that if the RMS error is greater than one that I say that can't possibly be

263
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
So if it's greater than one s k equals one otherwise it's going to be between Z

264
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
Your own one and so I can say fprintf F4 Scentsy and I can

265
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320
Comprension

266
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
Okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to take the

267
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:49,120
The amount of error so runoff these is the part of the algorithm that oriented riorio

268
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
Lighthouse to try to figure out from this particular point of view what is the best orientation and then

269
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,384
He tells us how good matches that from that particular position

270
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
And I'll tell you okay so from this particular position

271
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,184
This particular position I just can't get into it looks terrible it looks terrible so

272
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
That's what we're going to be looking at from a given position does runoff D say good or bad

273
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
Don't want to just see what that heatmap looks like going to go here print

274
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,384
FF cell dump the data

275
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,784
Cycle equals 0 f close app

276
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
Try it and see if this thing works I have an error forgot to include

277
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
STD in stud h

278
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:54,656
Okay oh it's safe faulted that's a bummer cheap TV

279
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
Ron

280
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,080
35 then I work PT

281
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
85 printsf cell

282
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,464
Why is that not good

283
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
Nil-nil

284
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,592
Okay boom

285
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
Cool let's see if it made the file it did hexdump Dash Cyril

286
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,832
Lighthouse data less Caleb's take a look at this

287
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
It's like most areas are ff0 you know what we should probably convert that so that the areas that have

288
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,632
A whole bunch of air would be very low on the heat map so I'm going to say 1.0 - SK

289
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:04,032
All of that * 255

290
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
Got something okay

291
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
Okay see here

292
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
Try loading it and see what it says so the

293
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,680
Exercise is when we say it was 64 by 64 by 30

294
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
2 I think

295
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:41,408
No Dona flip and no it's not an rgba math so this is the very first time

296
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,808
I will have seen this date I have no idea what it looks like other than some random printouts I've done here in there I've been no way of visual

297
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
What's a pasta Clive survive

298
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
Tools plane test

299
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
Call Lighthouse data hello look at that that is interesting

300
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,408
I don't quite know where the exies are on this but that's interesting that it's star

301
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,808
A point which looks like about 00 actually it is 0-0

302
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,672
It says everything from anywhere near there is good

303
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,720
Ha

304
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:33,120
Maybe we need to tighten that up some let's make it so

305
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
So * 10 so now will be more difficult for to look

306
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Good

307
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
Oh hello okay so what we're seeing here is

308
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
In 3D space representation for all of the possible places that that Lighthouse camera should be in

309
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:05,120
And that is not the shape I would have expected

310
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
Brendan just said it looks like a human brain I would not have expected I would have

311
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:17,920
Expected that the lighthouse would have had a harder time determining depth away from the Target and an easier time determining

312
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
Opposition to draw a. Right at 0-0

313
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:30,720
So I can tell where the origin would be

314
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
How would I do that

315
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,704
That would be

316
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,104
How can I be in here

317
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
If

318
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
What am I looking at if easy

319
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
And the x is greater than 0.4 - 0

320
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
0.014 01 and I guess

321
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
Heated d y is greater than - S01 and ey lesson

322
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,760
You're one then

323
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:37,536
We're going to print 255 so we can at least have an origin

324
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,664
Are you answering the lighthouse play OC you guys are actually helping out with the answers

325
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
Okay so this this thing here is a cloud of of I'd like I guess points of where the camera could be

326
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,464
Be relative to the the lighthouse I'm going to cut into that a little bit more to see

327
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,864
Okay so these are all approximate Aries let's let's make it even harder so make it 100

328
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
So it have to be a very very close match for even a few guys

329
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,664
Crazy weird

330
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
Try with a more constrictive

331
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,440
So now it should be much smaller

332
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,000
Harry around it

333
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
How awesome knowing I guess not visible at all from that

334
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360
Try that again it's 2:20

335
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:08,160
Who is this is really cool it looks like as we start to really tighten down it is much

336
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,560
It's really getting clumped around a specific area very well I wonder if there's some sort of numerical method we could use

337
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
In order to say take this data and then fit it with like a gossie and curve or something to figure out where it is bad

338
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,568
Cuz right now I'm just sitting through every point trying to find the best one

339
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
Keep pushing a spider and Tighter in seeing what this looks like

340
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,832
Are you guys in chat having fun watching me like do this or

341
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Like

342
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
Okay so I'm I'm this is not boring to people

343
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:51,168
But don't actually understand what's going on if you okay then tell you what guys I will in about two or three

344
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,568
3 minutes I will go do a review over how the HTC Vive does the fee

345
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
Think it does and then if you guys don't want to watch that you can go like to the bathroom or so

346
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
Something so this is looking really promising cuz

347
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
From my point of view that's a much I was expecting this to look very different so there's clearly some Jitter

348
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
But for the most part the expectation for where the camera is is is pretty good

349
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,568
Maybe this might actually be sufficient to to go do the problem with

350
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,968
Do this from an absolute Point of View 250

351
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:42,368
50 nevermind I had it

352
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
Little bit unrestricted so it still is not really that sure

353
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:55,168
Text as we tighten that up try 50

354
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,568
Okay

355
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
Looks pretty good for those of you who didn't notice I changed the levels on the side originally

356
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
Was a very restrictive point of view so let's try keeping on tightening this up and seeing what

357
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
We got

358
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,864
I don't understand

359
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
Out having your nursing onebeacon in the visitors right now how would that look with two

360
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,872
Are you at that point can you let that happen when I look at two beacons

361
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
That's a lighthouse o lookin that we're both beacons are that's a really good idea let's let's do

362
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:48,928
Do that so this is one weekend so unfortunately I have it loaded is

363
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Is lrr so it's into different files and I'd have to merge those two together to

364
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,400
How would I do that

365
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
See what I can just write a program I can just do it once for the AR and do once for the AL someone to go Lucy

366
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
This up a little bit so it's not quite as restrictive

367
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,144
Okay so this is

368
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
Time just find a good a good level to visualize

369
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,944
That looks pretty good so there's the hmd in the middle

370
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
And there is one Lighthouse up there

371
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,856
And now let's

372
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
My copy that file CP

373
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,912
Raw Lighthouse data and that's for the our lighthouse

374
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
Stop. I'm going to do it again for the L Lighthouse so

375
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,456
Are Lighthouse over there a lighthouse over here I think

376
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
Also I just realized we move this window over here then when I look at the window I'll be looking at the

377
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,656
Okay hope you had to be a little bit less disconcerting to everybody

378
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,984
Fat donkey when I keep looking now that you in that you

379
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
Sol Lighthouse let's run this again for the L Lighthouse let's see

380
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
See what that data looks like

381
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,096
Oh I can't find me a lighthouse

382
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:10,496
Make it much less restrictive

383
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
Spencer and days

384
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,440
Oh that's interesting the other Lighthouse it has no idea where it is

385
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
That's not good I was expecting so okay will look at these two lighthouses

386
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:42,240
Was in the same dataset how to do that right now

387
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,840
Again I'd like to remind everybody out there if you guys have a

388
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:14,240
A know where to find the list of all the points on a on a Watchman control

389
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:20,640
Color and all the normals of where all the points are on the Watchmen controller so it points the normals in space of the Watchmen

390
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
Please post that to the issue on GitHub and in chat telling us that you have it cuz I don't know where to find it and I know I've seen

391
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
Before I don't really want to go look for it in the middle of a live stream

392
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
So right now we have our lighthouse in Ella Lighthouse data

393
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,240
And I'm going to go write a program real quick to just that data together

394
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:31,295
Again

395
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
Michael

396
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
If you think that's what you're working on is something that would be interested these people and if they want to like hop in, tan

397
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
Anything I think I'm going to be like I'm only going to work in B like spurts like this

398
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,079
I'm so if you want to think about something you'd want to talk about on a live stream

399
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Think about it

400
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,783
I'm sure another hour or something be ready to go and David for you guys he's out of frame right now David Chapman

401
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,415
He is also here so he's the guy who is working on Matrix

402
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:45,279
That's Dave waving that's inverse phase right there and that's Mike over

403
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,583
On the side and

404
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,167
Neighborhood back

405
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:57,567
They'll be talking about various Vive related things later on in this broadcast

406
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
There we go

407
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:07,039
And again thanks to Unity for a buying provide for me

408
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
So right now I'm reading the the left Lighthouse stay to the right

409
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:19,839
Lighthouse Daytona be dumped it into a dual Lighthouse Ada so I can visualize it so this reads the right this reads

410
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:26,239
Lisa left for eichel zeroize + 131072

411
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
Plus I'm going to be dumping into

412
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:39,039
The output file 05

413
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:45,439
Data are dildi and

414
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:51,839
Maybe you should just be 255 255

415
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:58,239
0hone oh no that's not right hand

416
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
Our car is RDI and lre

417
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
Kohl's ldi and Alpha equals

418
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,791
Why would I do that

419
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,703
Are are straighter than

420
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:36,127
Lrso are otherwise LR2 alphapix the most important one

421
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
R r is greater than 1 R equals 10

422
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:48,927
Her

423
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:03,007
Yes

424
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:09,407
I can't do that actually be fine so

425
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
Rd LD and Alpha let's just try that

426
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,671
Oh what did I do wrong

427
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
What did I do wrong

428
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
Spanish Spanish

429
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:35,007
Try and catch up with it.

430
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:47,807
Moderator

431
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
Take a look at what the stain looks like so that's the probability for the the derby

432
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
Elite now we're going to use an RGB a map and we'll take a look at the combiners

433
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
Google lighthouse data

434
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
Okay

435
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,543
So that's a little interesting

436
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:14,943
Wonder why the one light house is completely terrible and very poorly grouped and the other lighthouse

437
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:21,343
So wonderful and very tightly grouped

438
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
Not right to cuz I think was from about this point of view and both lighthouses are pro

439
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:33,631
Probably at about the same height okay

440
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
That's really troubling though so the red one tightly

441
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:07,423
Group that means that we're pretty sure that that's where the camera is and each one of these cells let's see

442
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,311
How big each one of these blocks represents one of these blocks represents

443
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
I guess

444
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
5 / 64 decimeters are sorry 64

445
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:32,511
Divisions that's 7.8 CM so the grouping on this one

446
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,119
One would have to be about 1

447
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:43,519
Count the 123456 about 6

448
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,919
7.8 CM blocks

449
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:56,319
More densely populated area sensor

450
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,719
I think

451
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:09,119
About the same number sensors to oriented it to the lighthouse was directly between the two

452
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:15,519
Hamsa means it's 4.6 even on the tight Ones Still 4.6 DM

453
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,919
Oh wait no I'm using exactly the same

454
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:28,319
Directions it's exactly the same code checking each side

455
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:34,719
No there's nothing reflective on the floor

456
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:41,119
That's really odd I guess we could just take more data we're going to turn off the

457
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:47,519
The lights though because you guys check it out I'm using a drop lights to light it up

458
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,919
Open lights look really good on film but tungsten Laika I guess could potentially mess up the

459
00:49:54,175 --> 00:50:00,319
Five star centers

460
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
I guess it's time that I go and I do my little steal again on how the The Vibes

461
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,887
Survived by his do that mean yet how old am I

462
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:20,287
Works I guess at least my perspective on it

463
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,383
Good can you guys hear me is this clear

464
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,455
Levels good levels look good I guess I'll just start talking

465
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,015
Okay

466
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
So I guess you can't really see it but it's fine

467
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,815
HTC Vive this thing right here is far as I'm concerned the complete

468
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
Future of everything VR and that's because of room scale so bunch of different people

469
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
You'll have like kind of gone into direction to try to make Ruthy lvr and people are doing

470
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,663
Cameras and other stuff

471
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:04,063
But there is a technology that I had never even thought of and I've done computer vision things before I just

472
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
Never saw it I never I don't know how to get those living under a rock and it's this idea of Lighthouse technology

473
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
I've been saying Lighthouse Lighthouse Lighthouse lighthouse in a lighthouse is one of these

474
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,935
Little boxes so like this thing

475
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,775
Nothing right up here

476
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
That is a lighthouse

477
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,895
Kind of see it flashing a little bit and

478
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
Showing the

479
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,343
I'm going to see a red light and then two scanners and the way it works

480
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
Is

481
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,863
The way it works is by taking a flashing flooding the scene with lighted

482
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,263
Like a like a camera flash and that tells all of the little dimples on these guy

483
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
Guys all of these little sensors

484
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,967
On this exactly like hey synchronize know what time it is right now and

485
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:10,367
Then what it does is it takes a laser and it sweeps the laser across and it hits

486
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:16,767
One by one and it sweeps across the entire scene and so the time between that flash

487
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:23,167
And when it actually sweeps and hits the different sensors that's how it knows exact

488
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:28,287
Zackly where in this Dimension it is relative to the lighthouse

489
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
Does it again for this dimension

490
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,503
Hitting all of the sensors all the way down and the cool thing is it doesn't from to lighthouses so it still

491
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:43,903
Uses imuse like many of the other systems like The Sixth Sense and the the controller is in the PA

492
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:50,303
PS2 PS3 and 4 and all that to tell like oh I'm moving really quick in this way so it doesn't have to

493
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
Wait on the data from the lighthouses to figure out where it is let me taste it does know where it is but from frame-to-frame

494
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:03,103
If I move it it doesn't need to wait on the lighthouses to tell if I moved a little bit you can tell that really mediately

495
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,503
At the lighthouses give you the ability to track basically and unlimited number of points

496
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,903
In a 3D space and track them very very precisely and absolutely

497
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,303
And that is something that is kind of like the Holy Grail of cracking and that's why I think the HTC Vive is like

498
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,703
Wheatley the future of how this works and so again it is you sweep past and so we're trying to do in

499
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
This project is a much larger scale project it's one that

500
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:41,503
It's going to have impact as far as the goal would be to make it so you can just straight-up right games in life

501
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:47,903
Survive for very very minimal framework so an HTC Vive

502
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:54,303
Something that says clearly

503
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,911
Requires a VR capable computer

504
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:05,311
Right there I think that's a little bit ridiculous and I'm going to see if I can get it to run

505
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,663
On this my Gen 2 Core i5

506
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:16,063
Really really horrible book that has integrated Intel graphics

507
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,463
Good overview if you guys have any questions feel free to ask her right now

508
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,703
So I've been working with Steve I've since

509
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:39,103
Early summer I am Mike and I was curious that I've seen this

510
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,503
Survive can both locate where is currently but it also has a bit of a predictive aspect break until we're

511
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:51,903
It should be is well is your library going to handle that or is it just going to leave that

512
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,303
Leave that be for now that we're working with Dave on Dave

513
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,703
Batman is also in the back over here and for working with Kim on

514
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
On some more of the details about the Calvin filter and it'll be using motions guitar

515
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
Understand

516
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
To tell both

517
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Like

518
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
Based on my current motion

519
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:23,135
I expected this time even if I haven't received any sensor updates I expect to be here

520
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,631
Prediction time

521
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:39,263
Right tell your best estimate of State at the next time step given

522
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,663
Information from only the previous timestamp and there's another term which is your best estimate of current safe

523
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:52,063
Question is how much do you weight new information versus your prediction of

524
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:04,351
Oh yeah okay so I was just over there

525
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:10,751
Is it just the right place to be

526
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,551
We are figuring this out and so I was just I was just mentioning

527
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
Common filters are predictive filter so there are really there really to

528
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
2 * 1 is the best estimate of State at the current time stamp given

529
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,751
Only information from the previous timestamp so that best estimate is entirely a prediction

530
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:49,151
And that prediction would include your current position your velocity acceleration

531
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:55,551
And also all your acceleration in direction as well so then the other term

532
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:01,951
Would be your best estimate of position or or partial estimate of of of position

533
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:08,351
Given only information that you can see at the current point in time so really

534
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:14,751
The question is how much do you weight those two terms and depending on your measurement mod

535
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:21,151
Can have an uncertainty model for your measurements and depending on what those weights are you know just because

536
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:27,551
Just because the accuracy or the Precision of a sensor is ex doesn't mean we can't change them

537
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:33,951
Number to make it Whately prediction part more weight the or wait the measurements more

538
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:40,351
Really interesting that I actually learned

539
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:46,751
About these I don't even know how long ago when I was in the Navy I worked on the IMU

540
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:53,151
You are the Gyros for the ship itself and that was one of these systems that was working on and

541
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:59,551
Part of that was learning how a Coleman filter worked and how they calibrated so

542
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,951
It's always interesting to learn about that and then suddenly almost 10 years down the road have this come back up

543
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:12,351
Yeah nana nana

544
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:18,751
So while they're off to the side of briefly just a common filter is actually

545
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:25,151
Used it a lot of different places I was on a cruiser in the US Navy

546
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:31,551
And are gyros for the ship actually used a common filter to help us with dead reckoning and cuz

547
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,575
Possession

548
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:38,207
Something the chat mentions uavs and flight control as an exciting

549
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:44,607
Also used in other applications such as uavs flight control or

550
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:51,007
Any place where you could have data coming in or you could be reduced to a dead reckoning stay

551
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:57,407
Due to either loss of data or unreliable data coming in

552
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,807
Anybody else in chat really said much that we should be dressing right now that's okay

553
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:10,207
Anybody else from chat want to mention anything or grab me other questions until we

554
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,071
I guess some point look at the next thing on the agenda for tonight

555
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:21,471
Wow

556
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,871
Matthew Jones asked then why would it affect one of them only one of them I don't understand

557
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,271
Sorry they're talking about the noise patterns why it would affect only one of the lighthouses

558
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:40,671
I don't I don't know I think

559
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:47,071
Specific to women filters and like what we're talking about right now

560
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:53,471
So Nathan I saw you were asking if we could feed accelerometers or data

561
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:59,871
From the inertial directly from the accelerometer as you can but by applying the Cullman

562
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:06,271
Able to smooth it out and get a more accurate picture of what's actually happening then just taking an arsenal

563
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:12,671
Later right off and saying okay but we must be going exactly that far using the call me smooth

564
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
And control what you're seeing instead of just trying to shoot raw data at it and see what happens

565
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,271
So I think it's actually probably went back to this cuz he asked me about that

566
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,671
Where do you want to work let Charles move back to the visualization

567
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:51,071
Science for a while so I didn't want to stay

568
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,471
Destination and so bad at measuring

569
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:03,871
Where it is I don't know

570
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:10,271
Anybody has any ideas that would be super cool cuz I did not know the air

571
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:16,671
Airbound look like this okay

572
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:23,071
So I guess I should also mention the sweeps and the way that works is that what goes on is lighthouse

573
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:29,471
House number one of their sweeps flashes sweeps flashes sweeps then

574
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
Lighthouse flashes sweeps flashes sweeps

575
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
You've been scolded for being too loud

576
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:44,575
Oh I'm sorry I'll be more careful with that in the future I will I will I'm learning

577
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,975
I don't know a splitter Suites creeps and beliefs baseball

578
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:57,375
Sorry

579
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:10,175
Way less accurate like super less accurate that's not what reality is showing us right now

580
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:16,575
And right now this is solely looking at

581
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:22,975
Efreet one of these these red and green blobs it's only look how hey it's kind of Christmas-themed it's only looking at the

582
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,559
Is the depth right

583
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:32,959
That's a really good question let's find out if the death is right I'm going to go back to

584
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:39,615
Plane test to camfind at sea

585
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
But Ron give me a solution oh you know what we need to collect more data

586
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:54,719
Really good time on what I'm going to do is I'm going to set up this system exactly is is I would

587
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
Would set it up to do the calibration and I'll record some data and I'll post this data into the issue

588
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:07,519
And then we'll use that data collected from this time to check it and we're going to tape measure

589
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:13,919
You're in measure the actual position to the lighthouses so

590
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
How the lighthouse position it I don't know about race

591
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:28,511
On the floor that you can kind of see that

592
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:34,911
EXO

593
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,495
I had not this play is right here on the floor

594
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:44,895
Positioning it to that a bunch of sensors can be seen from the point of view of both lighthouse

595
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:52,063
I don't know you think I should make it to this pointing this way or some

596
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,463
Tween the two lighthouses know it is

597
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
I'm not measuring anything between the two lighthouses

598
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,191
We want to do we want to spoil the

599
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,615
Popcorn so

600
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:22,015
This the date is entirely to do with the headset data coming from just the headsets not the

601
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:28,415
Do lighthouses unless it's somebody else knows is there an is there a photo sensor inside the lighthouses is it there

602
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,815
The photo center inside the lighthouses by gosh now we have another absolute datapoint or reference so we can find out

603
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:41,215
Do actually communicate and synchronize with each other so they have to be visually

604
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,615
Insightful each other I think they I don't know how they do it exactly but if you do now I don't know so many

605
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:54,015
Online knows if there's a way for me to get the the data from like the lighthouse like like

606
01:04:54,271 --> 01:05:00,415
Oh I see the flashes coming from this other Lighthouse that I would be cool

607
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,695
I know that they do

608
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:08,095
Synchronize in some manner but I'm not sure the message I don't know how either method or protocol or anything I don't know how

609
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:14,495
Illuminates IR LED

610
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,591
In sequence in sync with ir cameras

611
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:25,247
So which is totally not the way I would want to do it

612
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:31,647
This way just trying it have it sitting on the floor it is right now oriented with the camera

613
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:38,047
Pointing towards I think that sell camera real lighthouse

614
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:42,655
I'll have Mike Like Houses said to be and

615
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:49,055
Channels BMC

616
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:55,455
Yes yeah one of the things been suggested we did before was to use one Lighthouse and mode

617
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:01,855
O'Day I did that I was able to get the data but I think it's much more interesting to just

618
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:08,255
ShopRite off of two lighthouses data

619
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
Nothing that I called Data recorder and I'm going to go run that

620
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:21,055
Make sure where is the

621
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
I'm going to just turn off right now the the Watchman and so we won't have

622
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:33,855
Watching data for this data recorder

623
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
Pipe tee live stream

624
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
Test one with light with hmd in Center. CS

625
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:53,055
Somebody was saying why don't you try hooking up to them using a USB kit

626
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:59,455
Or updating their firmware just to see what you can pull out of him somebody suggesting up to the USB

627
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:05,855
C cable I could but I tell you what if you

628
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:12,255
You go buy an HTC Vive system and you hook it up and you get some awesome day to go share

629
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:18,655
That dated with me I'm very very tight on time

630
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:25,055
Okay let's see is it doing it and I press 0

631
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:31,455
Send all okay so that's another thing sometimes for the hmd just stopped sending data and I'm not sure why

632
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,551
Give me the IMU data but it will not give me the lighthouse data

633
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,207
Pick something else

634
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,767
Testing just think that's Mike 1

635
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
Switch to mic

636
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
2

637
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,215
Oh hey good good

638
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,519
Okay

639
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:07,199
So sometimes for some reason the head-mounted display just stops giving me liked it and I don't

640
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
No Lie

641
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,087
So we're still trying to figure that one out but if I plug it in

642
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
Highway

643
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,903
I run the program

644
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
And then I say oh

645
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
Then

646
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
Should

647
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Still not giving

648
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,911
Try that again might have to restart the heading out to fly

649
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Also

650
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
Try again

651
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
Plug it in

652
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Kuwait

653
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Way

654
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,255
Run it

655
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Fresco

656
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
Poster

657
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,751
Send the magic to make it start sending me some data

658
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Not

659
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,295
Light

660
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
Sauron

661
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Why is it

662
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
Not working

663
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,279
Sometimes if I just poked at it for a while it starts working

664
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Okay

665
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:11,359
You hear me now hey that actually looks pretty good I guess they don't need to yell

666
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:17,759
Okay you guys should probably calibrated to this and it's not working what's try just giving

667
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
Butthead mouth play a full power down

668
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:30,559
I haven't got a background static yeah there's bacon cooking

669
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:36,959
In the find there that's not

670
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:43,359
The atom is cooking

671
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:49,759
No you don't but you can hear it

672
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:56,159
Rebooting the lighthouses here

673
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:02,559
Snow Moon

674
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:15,359
Beacon bacon

675
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:21,759
Yeah I'm hoping

676
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:28,159
Some of you guys end up getting a vibe to start you know troubleshooting this with me to help figure out like okay why is it sometimes being a

677
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,559
Little bit wacky with the with the two dots

678
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:40,959
Looks like houses are green oh give me data oh

679
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:47,359
Jada

680
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:53,759
Live in the normal capacity inside of unity

681
01:12:54,015 --> 01:13:00,159
Shanghai know their exclusive unfortunately

682
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:06,559
Actually been amazing for me Mike wanted to know if it would have been possible to collect data from the Vive the same time

683
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:12,959
As the steam interface I don't think that's possible

684
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:25,759
Sometimes it seems like five

685
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
John engineering the Vive to run on lesser Hardware

686
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:38,559
John wants to know if we are making a virtual wifey

687
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:44,959
Not making a virtual Wifey I'm pretty sure a virtual wife who will not run on this laptop

688
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:51,359
Mostly because if it was I think it would commit suicide to the laptop so bad

689
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:57,759
The other day they're trying to tell explict virtual waipuna capsules in Japan

690
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
It sits on your desk like Alexa but it's a VR girl

691
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:10,559
Plays off

692
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:16,959
I can't touch the back of my running oh got it I don't know why

693
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Magically works now there's a favorite in the background

694
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:29,759
Okay

695
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:36,159
Close curtains

696
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:42,559
Let me text

697
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,959
I hope you don't have to go do that

698
01:14:55,615 --> 01:15:01,759
Okay we're now collecting data off of these two

699
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:08,159
The two lighthouses I'm sorry about the Bilal thing in the other room that's currently

700
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:14,559
Making popcorn actuate

701
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:20,959
Quieter on your guy's end awesome collecting the data I'm going to run for another couple seconds and then we're going to stop

702
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:27,359
I was going to get a lot of data points do it averages out fairly nicely

703
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:40,159
I could probably best if you guys want

704
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:46,559
Watch the first video anybody who's new to this summary video between the two others

705
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:52,959
Can you post the link to my summary video so the 20-minute one

706
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:59,359
So I think that's probably enough stuff hey if you guys somebody wants to go do a

707
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:05,759
FAQ on the GitHub site if you want you can just do a pull request on my on my readme.md file

708
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:12,159
The second white house right now

709
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:18,559
Are they Independence right now the two lighthouses are completely independent the goal is

710
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:24,959
As soon as we get this thing off the ground that's when we'll use them in like coordination with each other in order to figure out

711
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:31,359
Better Where We Are

712
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:37,759
Tryna get this lined up better here

713
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,559
Don't worry

714
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:56,959
You guys will see the popcorn when it's done but you won't be able to taste it

719
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:28,959
This is the hmd static

720
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:35,359
And middle of the room

721
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,759
Okay now let's go upload that

722
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:48,159

Coughing on the guys from 5 matriarch contact looks like too much of a hassle

727
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:26,559
Okay I just published the copy of the test data so any of you guys who want to play along you can

728
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,959
Just go download this from Issue Number issue number 3 on online survive

And we will open this file instead

733
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:04,959
Where is that that somewhere here

734
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:17,759
How to rank amfine 4L

735
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:24,159
About Lee Hackley boats instead to use with Google cardboard okay so this is actually calibrate

736
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:30,559
Going pretty well what these these settings here show me is that

737
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:36,959
Every single one of the photodiodes on this one from the from the lighthouses point of

738
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:43,359
You is actually calibrating to under a millimeter of accuracy and this is the first time I've actually taken any day to wear

739
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:49,759
That's the case I'll feel like a complete idiot if it's because that's stupid window there was reflecting the beans and I was getting

740
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:56,159
False data that would be so dumb

741
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:02,559
I can just ignore datapoints they're just outside of the mean

742
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,959
You know what that's effort I don't really

743
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:15,360
I don't really have time to put in that kind

744
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:21,760
Kind of

745
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:28,160
Can't really do that so

746
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:34,560
Well let's go take this data brawl lighthouse..

747
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:40,960
Combiner miss one is El lighthouse..

748
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:47,360
Let's run it again with our

749
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:53,760
Queso from the other one's point of view the

750
01:20:54,016 --> 01:21:00,160
The one on that side that's actually a lot worse that says two of the sensors are to M&M's out

751
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:06,560
And that's not very good so I guess we'll just test that one anyway

752
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:19,360
So let's take a look at this date

753
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:25,760
Now by the way people keep posting articles in the

754
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:32,160
Issues please postcode code post patches there was an a little

755
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:38,560
Funny thing GCC did with experimental versions where you have to set an environment variable that says I promise to include

756
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:44,960
Food patches for all bug reports about ready to enforce that

757
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:51,360
Like I'll just post a link to something actually like posted a scussion from it

758
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:04,160
Who that's interesting

759
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:16,960
Haha that's actually

760
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:23,360
Worse

761
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:29,760
I would not have expected that to be worse

762
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:36,160
Why is that worse

763
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:42,560
Tell me nighttime now like looking over a very large range but

764
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:48,960
It shouldn't be this bad

765
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:55,360
I mean it's it's it's geometrically correct but that's still really depressing

766
01:22:55,616 --> 01:23:01,760
Okay so one of the things people wanted was they wanted to know if this was actually correct

767
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:08,160
Or not so let's see for the our lighthouse

768
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:14,560
It says it's 2.93 973 so let's just say 3M and let's

769
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:20,960
Check from the L lighthouses point-of-view from the L lighthouses

770
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:27,360
Point-of-view it says three point six years so let's check and see if that matches reality

771
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:33,760
Adam can you get a tape measure

772
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:40,160
Popcorn

773
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:59,360
Metric tape measure

774
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:05,760
I do choose my units based on the project if I deal with speed of light I do more things than.

775
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:12,160
If I do more things in a different mentor

776
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:18,560
So go to the nose on the access property line

777
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:24,960
293 cm

778
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:31,360
Okay so 22.9 3M let's check to this one

779
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:37,760
That would be I think that's like how can you do it less

780
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:44,160
Okay that would be Lighthouse to which I think is our and this one says

781
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:50,560
3.6 me about 3.65

782
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:56,960
So oh hey

783
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:03,360
Okay actually gone wrong it's 3.65 so okay so that's pretty close to three point

784
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:09,760
65 3.69 and

785
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:16,160
190 a little almost 300 so 2.9

786
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:22,560
This one is off by only 5 cm this one up here

787
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:28,960
That is all correct

788
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:35,360
PSL that's us right sets off by 5 cm and then the other one is off by I forgot

789
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:41,760
Cowboys number again 2.99

790
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:48,160
Okay whatever it's it's only off I like to see em so I think we're figuring out the locations

791
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:54,560
Of lighthouses pretty well right now not locations just right now all I can

792
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,960
On measuring distances from the lighthouse to the headset right there so I'm going to go

793
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:07,360
That's surprisingly good maybe we really can

794
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:13,760
Can't get away with this without doing a lot more work although I don't understand why the clouds are so terrible

795
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:20,160
Like that's just awful why is this data so

796
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:26,560
How bad I mean yes it can approximate distance great but

797
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:32,960
Cook Creek OK let's try it I've been curious about this

798
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:39,360
I want a I want to try it again except from inside having the

799
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:45,760
Hmd oriented this way don't have it oriented in playing with the lighthouses so I think they would be affecting

800
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:52,160
X primarily mostly affecting why

801
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:58,560
Soty this position I want to switch it to Italy this way

802
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
At least two recommendations to just walk away houses to make sure it's not a lot of people spend the night

803
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:24,160
Why I don't want to swap lighthouses

804
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:30,560
Physical difference in the way your lighthouses are operating

805
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
Just at the date as bad as for the

806
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
External if you swap the lighthouses then you'll get the same data whereas if the data if the

807
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:49,760
The difference of the lighthouses themselves that's a lot of work

808
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:56,160
If we would have just moved the VR headset. Yeah we can just do that

809
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:02,560
That's pretty good idea we can just write one another one real quick

810
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:08,960
Pipe tee

811
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:15,360
2 xxs.

812
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:21,760
Yesterday okay

813
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:28,160
Oh why did I do that that was I need to get it oriented first and then

814
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:34,560
How about you do that let me oriented yeah you do that and then I won't come again

815
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:40,960
Tell me what you want

816
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,360
Oh no I was going to have it sitting

817
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
Doing it the other way so upside down

818
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
Yeah I'm not I don't think I want to do nothing

819
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:06,560
Nothing too well yeah I don't think it'll work well either but let's find out

820
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:12,960
This way

821
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:19,360
Put the stator on for a little bit so right now the reason I think this won't work as well as cuz the things our group so tightly

822
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:25,760
It's kind of a hard time resolving any kind of meaningful distance out of it

823
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:32,160
Thai Kitchen 1

824
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:38,560
I was just had a question for you Charles whether or not there was some tunable thrush

825
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:44,960
Threshold that could be adjusted that might affect the size of the client thing that it has to be within some

826
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:51,360
Aerotolerant or if there's some

827
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:57,760
Confidence that used to have anyting I think that, I think a lot

828
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:04,160
I do have a lot of stuff going on with the algorithm that finds the right orientation and there's a lot of heuristics that go on

829
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:10,560
On with that so it's entirely possible that algorithm could be improved significantly

830
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:16,960
Be more reliable that maybe there's just something about the state of it's making it not resolve well but

831
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:23,360
I don't know where I would search for that cuz I mean

832
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:29,760
Unitus returning a single point cloud

833
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:36,160
Adam are you done with the okay I'm switching the microphone back in

834
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:42,560
Into slightly louder mode okay

835
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:55,360
I mean I also update the

836
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:01,760
Can I put axies on it

837
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
She's on it

838
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:14,560
Just a penalty at like you tight went on just on the chair or something somewhere

839
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:20,960
Closer to where you actually using it well it has to be able to track their as well

840
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:27,360
Because to calibrate seafloor height there is a calibration

841
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:40,160
Also Toby asks what the points of the top of the gooey arm and is that skiing

842
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:46,560
Hopsin the gooey oh okay so the points the top of the gooey

843
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:52,960
I guess I can bring that back up what that's about is if I don't get data from

844
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:59,360
Both lighthouses for sorry know if I don't get data from both X and Y no great

845
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,760
Now it's not giving me data so I can't show you but

846
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:12,160
I can wake it up

847
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:18,560
Or not if he's not want to wake up

848
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:24,960
Does green but is it really waking up or is it just lying to me

849
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:37,760
Let me just try to run this right now

850
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:44,160
I'm going to run with this new data

851
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:50,560
Can you maybe make a note on the voxel plot of the size of each block so you can have asked

852
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:56,960
I'm not mad that the box of pathic no

853
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:03,360
Pull request so if you want to go out that you can go out that and I'll go say okay

854
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:09,760
Some happy

855
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:16,160
One camera green is the other camera

856
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:22,560
Voxels the inverse of the RMS error of the points from the cameras pointed

857
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:28,960
View at that position

858
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:35,360
Hello there has to be a full red yes absolutely

859
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:41,760
Is that impossible Pathak

860
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:48,160
To draw as red then it could be that a very small number of points are full red

861
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:54,560
Yeah but I

862
01:33:54,816 --> 01:34:00,960
Mike no more involved

863
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:07,360
Future please o

864
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:13,760
What which which aspect would I commit which which thing if you can find

865
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:20,160
Find out whoever was the one of me to commit just tell me specifically what aspect you want the tools committed or what what do you

866
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:26,560
You want committed or do you want the combiner committed

867
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:39,360
Taxis on Vauxhall magic taxis on Vauxhall Magic

868
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:45,760
Catholic there is no axes unlockable tastic

869
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:52,160
Do you want me to add the feature okay what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to make it so

870
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:58,560
Help getting axes from Boxville tastic I'm just going to make it so it points

871
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:04,960
In the y direction direction by Direction

872
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:11,360
Please open the headset I'll make it print up in the y direction

873
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:17,760
Call Candy is that

874
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:24,160
Randy Wise less than 0.234

875
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:30,560
Okay it'll have a little bit pale pointing in the

876
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:36,960
I'll make it do an X and Y both

877
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:43,360
That'll have a little bit like a coordinate frame thing going on

878
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:56,160
Let's see how old is this one resolved

879
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,560
Unresolved to at worst

880
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:08,960
666 micrometer micrometer that's right that's millions of M

881
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:15,360
I believe so that's incredible actually

882
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:21,760
It is possible science

883
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:28,160
Yes it is it is actually resolving 22 right here this one looks like the worst one

884
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:34,560
Resolve in the best 147 micrometer so I think this date is going to look pretty good

885
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:40,960
Although know what you know what no no no because they're closer together

886
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:47,360
You'll naturally resolved to lower errors and that that's just so it's really not to act

887
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:53,760
It is an artifact okay I was really excited there about it you know resolving so

888
01:36:54,016 --> 01:37:00,160
Tightly

889
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:06,560
In that direction

890
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:19,360
How fast is our Outlook to run it 90 times per second

891
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:25,760
So the algorithm for this only needs to get run once ever once it's run

892
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:32,160
Once we know the position of lighthouses and then it's much easier to do the inverse of this problem which can happen

893
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:38,560
Super duper fast make sure it's the right one L Lighthouse Good2Go

894
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:44,960
I was running again for the our lighthouse

895
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:51,360
Are Lighthouse done

896
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:57,760
Combines the data

897
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:10,560
That's nice still realtor

898
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:16,960
Totally week and that's odd that there's this one point down and I'll make it totally clear

899
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:23,360
Google

900
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:29,760
That's weird are good at the ballgame

901
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:36,160
Gothic there no boys

902
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:42,560
It's not liking that okay

903
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:48,960
I don't know the concert

904
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:55,360
Is everything under a certain RMS is bright red

905
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:01,760
No it's it's the color red

906
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:08,160
Is the is independent but the capacity is depending on how wet it is

907
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:14,560
So right yeah so so so so the full opacity is that set to a specific

908
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:20,960
Value of RMS or is that dependent on the smallest RMS you find Abby

909
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:27,360
I'm wondering whether whether box of pasta cuz you

910
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:33,760
Using an absolute or relative color scale

911
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:40,160
In a specific RMS in meters is

912
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:46,560
Are meters squared is set to a specific capacity okay so to answer that question I have that code

913
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:52,960
Going to places one is right here where I take the RMS error and I * 10

914
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:59,360
AB greater than one I just don't worry about it it's just I set it to 1 if it's less than one which means that it's it's better

915
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:05,760
Better that I make it less than one and then I saved the inverse of that out out to the file

916
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:12,160
So it looks like you're not and nowhere are you Computing the men or Max or the average or anything

917
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:18,560
So so I guess my my my thought is that let's say you have a situation where

918
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:24,960
A lot of points that have a low our mess but there's one point that has an even even even orders of magnitude

919
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:31,360
So all of them would show up in the cloud I would see that in here so what I would do is I can set this

920
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:37,760
Higher so I can set this to say like 200 or like

921
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:44,160
Jordan 39

922
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:50,560
One of these yes so I guess what I'm saying is not be that huge green cloud and might be that those are the o

923
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:56,960
That's a good point scale you just had a color scale it wasn't so Jen

924
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:03,360
So generous right that everything look like it was everything look like a good fit but there was only

925
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:09,760
One point that was an even better fit right that's a good point Okay so

926
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:16,160
Oh yeah sorry the yellow thing in the middle is the headset and I was going to try to make an access point which way was wiped

927
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,560
Boss but I mess that up somehow

928
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:28,960
Okay just you guys know the Axis ad is going to have to happen

929
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:35,360
I guess it can happen in combiner that's probably the best place to put it would be in combiner let me go

930
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
Make a makefile for combiners that that's at least reasonable

931
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:48,160
Make file

932
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:54,560
Writing a C programming to make file

933
01:41:54,816 --> 01:42:00,960
Is the wrong with me smile

934
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:07,360
Coaling combiner combiner coaling combiner. Cdcr Co dollar at

935
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:13,760
Dollar carrot clean rm-rf combiner

936
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:20,160
Make combiner

937
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:26,560
Ron's okay

938
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:39,360
This looks like it's running okay so I'm going to go commit combiner now

939
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:45,760
What is an right

940
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:52,160
Don't recursively commit I don't remember the command for that

941
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:58,560
Cursive Lee I don't want to add recursively get ad now

942
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:04,960
Does anyone remember off Catherine

943
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:11,360
Read what the command is to commit a folder but not everything in the folder

944
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:17,760
Move the files out of a folder and then unit in the news

945
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:24,160
David suggesting copying the files out of the folder committing the folder and then

946
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:30,560
Moving moving not copying

947
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:36,960
Or something

948
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:49,760
I'm familiar with the CPP and sdp commands and

949
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:56,160
Very familiar with the overwrite okay okay fine I'll just copy the file move the file download go from there

950
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:02,560
Somebody's showing how to there's one way to know it commits LS.

951
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:08,960
I can't commit the folder inside the other folder until I commit the folder that has the fold how do I say that

952
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:15,360
You're going to move the files out and committed technology

953
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:21,760
Oh yeah

954
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:47,360
Good that's fine everything is fine now

955
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:53,760
Define okay

956
01:44:54,016 --> 01:45:00,160
Special okay that's working

957
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:06,560
Totally works everything's fine no we're not coming

958
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:12,960
What the bacon is going to be a part of

959
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:19,360
Bacon pancakes

960
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:25,760
Making popcorn pancakes with I still think you should

961
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:32,160
Sungold bag popcorn I really do want to find a good way to make

962
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:38,560
Savory popcorn oil and then powdered

963
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
Tell me something else you can blaze it with I wasn't joking when I said you could put it in the car

964
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:51,360
Caramel it will work try it I think you're insane okay that's all

965
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:57,760
All up-to-date so now I got to track down in these clouds figure out what's going on

966
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:04,160
I'm not really sure myself though that data looks pretty good

967
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:10,560
In the ranges are pretty good I don't really know what's up with from the red point-of-use let's actually look at that right now

968
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:16,960
Who dudududududududu playing test

969
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:23,360
Let's see which one is this is this a good one of the bad one this is

970
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:29,760
Terrible terrible data let's take a look and see why

971
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:36,160
There you go

972
01:46:55,616 --> 01:47:01,760
This dude actually looks pretty good

973
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:08,160
Oh I think that they wanted you to do is to take Levi and

974
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:14,560
Close to 1 and close to the other and compare the results I can do that

975
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:20,960
Okay sure I'll do that in a minute I will do

976
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:27,360
Vivelle and vybar okay well I'm really can

977
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:33,760
Dana doesn't look all that bad is Maya my calculating RMS is wrong

978
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:46,560
Calculator

979
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:52,960
Matheny has not been friends as of late it's pretty good

980
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:59,360
I mean it's a little off but not that bad

981
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:05,760
I just think it's off by so much

982
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:12,160
I guess it is right even though it's a very small amount

983
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:18,560
Radians in this graph I guess that makes sense that

984
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:24,960
Just doesn't look like it cuz it would be like on the surface of the the thing here to here

985
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:31,360
I guess that's for mm

986
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:37,760
Does it calculate the position at the street bottles and then

987
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:44,160
Pick the best one is out your body here is it calculates the best air

988
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:50,560
Area of voxels to look inside of from the best voxel it down the previous round and then it searches in there

989
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:56,960
Churches near 30th and Edgerton it does it does actually narrow down

990
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:03,360
Not binary but like a multi-dimensional iterative tightening surgery or something

991
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:09,760
Hierarchical I like that word Dave

992
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:16,160
That was our Lighthouse looks like an L lighthouse

993
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:22,560
Okay take the stator and take a look at

994
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:28,960
At it in the graph and see if it's spot-on

995
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:41,760
Okay the other day to look good but the

996
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:48,160
Just looks amazing yeah okay I understand

997
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:54,560
Now the other day. You could see the red dots behind you can't see the red dots behind on this one there just

998
01:49:54,816 --> 01:50:00,960
It's so good

999
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:07,360
You supposed to store data is beautiful again so I really supposed to start

1000
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:13,760
There needs to be more context as to why this is so beautiful

1001
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:20,160
The setup for this date of the second data is with the sides of the lighthouse or sides

1002
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:26,560
Bhmd pointed to the two lighthouses let me update that in here

1003
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:52,160
Okay so right now I think it's time that we

1004
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:58,560
Go and point the lighthouse straight on at one point hmd

1005
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:04,960
Those two words straight point the hmd straighten it one light house so it'll be like crystal clear

1006
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:11,360
Cleanest day can't be confused it'll still be confused I just know it

1007
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:17,760
Posted real quick before I do that sweet posted this the lighthouse USB protocol

1008
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:24,160
But the stuff

1009
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:30,560
Doesn't give me

1010
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:36,960
Give me celebration

1011
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:43,360
Hmd Lighthouse centers

1012
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:49,760
Actually Lighthouse centers mr. Redbeard if you know if

1013
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:56,160
This is actually like the hmd although this is not aged in because that's where I'm getting the data from

1014
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:02,560
But I'm wondering though is there any way of getting light data from the lighthouses themselves

1015
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:08,960
And I don't see it would by the way this this some of this is men are all you're going to have to

1016
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:15,360
Update some of the states of some of the things we found

1017
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:21,760
What is this wireless buds Wireless me a trigger button touched the Watchmen

1018
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:28,160
Yeah it's all watching stuff so now I don't see anywhere in this document it's

1019
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:34,560
Saying where it goes

1020
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:40,960
GitHub

1021
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:47,360
Reference does not show anything

1022
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:53,760
About Lighthouse Park receive

1023
01:52:54,016 --> 01:53:00,160
Living light data

1024
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:06,560
Check this

1025
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:12,960
Oh actually I should show you guys the photodiode that I intend to use

1026
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:19,360
Use 444 my experiments with this it's cheap

1027
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:25,760
Cheap okay so this guy was one that okay

1028
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:32,160
That's interesting this guy does have a bit of things about the

1029
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:38,560
The position calculation of the although he's doing it at a much smaller scale

1030
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:44,960
And he's doing it based on the known positions and it's using math what I can do is to

1031
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:51,360
For this to Dave though if they've stopped for looking at it

1032
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:57,760
What you're going to do is go to the GitHub live survive page and looking Issue Number 3

1033
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:04,160
Third post from the bottom and see if you can make any sense from it

1034
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:10,560
No We spelled Unity correctly

1035
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:16,960
Cuz I understand it so it was before

1036
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:23,360
For the game engine right it was like the same year that their company was founded okay so yeah there is no

1037
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:29,760
No relationship between Unity Technologies the people or helping make this happen right now

1038
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:36,160
And unity the game engine

1039
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:42,560
Different things we use them but they don't pay me so

1040
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:48,960
Okay so if you do such right now

1041
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:55,360
We're going to go not camfind we're going to

1042
01:54:55,616 --> 01:55:01,760
Data record

1043
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:08,160
The rest will be Lighthouse lrh MD

1044
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:14,560
Pointed at

1045
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:20,960
Still put the lighthouse appointed

1046
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:27,360
At that lighthouse

1047
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:33,760
Facebook

1048
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:05,760
So now it's it's pretty close to the other lighthouses actually on the floor you can't see it from

1049
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:12,160
Right there lighthouses right there

1050
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:18,560
Focus camera focus focus come on

1051
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:24,960
You can do it one focus camera focus focus

1052
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:37,760
Not fine whatever Justin want to focus

1053
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:50,560
Yeah it's collecting data

1054
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:56,960
What's what this run briefly

1055
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:03,360
The lot of lights that are in view

1056
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:09,760
We mentioned that they made me on FM was there anything else you'd like

1057
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:22,560
Recommendations for learning C Lennox I know the teams

1058
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:28,960
Kind of odd but if you start actually using Linux and you have the environment they're in Lenox it really makes it easy to

1059
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:35,360
I want to do X and you can go get love whatever libraries you need and all of that just get moving see and when

1060
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:41,760
Windows it's a lot harder to get all the pieces and bits to make you do something useful and fun

1061
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:48,160
Now since you can use the Linux embedded in Windows you can actually get started without

1062
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:54,560
Diving holy into the Waters of hell that you're not ready for no that's

1063
01:57:54,816 --> 01:58:00,960
Terrible I tried doing the Linux on Windows saying everything is broken you type in D message and it just says not implement

1064
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:07,360
Recycling like live USB broken

1065
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:20,160
So what all did you say was broken

1066
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:26,560
What's USB if you want to access hard

1067
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:32,960
Where it's really easy and say yeah

1068
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:39,360
Hmd pointed at Lighthouse Nursery now get it can find at sea

1069
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:45,760
I think we should be on the L1 so

1070
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:58,560
This I didn't edit it yet

1071
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:04,960
Somebody would like to know if you accounted for the slightly different origins The X and Y Suites

1072
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:11,360
How you should not need to account for different origins of X and Y sweeps that I'm aware of

1073
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:17,760
Because the center of the effective sweet like not where the

1074
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:24,160
The actual emitter is but where the access that it's rotating around is should be sent

1075
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:30,560
I heard inside of the like this one goes this way in the song goes this way it should actually have a point in the center of

1076
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:36,960
Whoever were considering the lighthouse to be

1077
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:56,160
Thankful

1078
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:02,560
Yeah

1079
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:08,960
Hahaha

1080
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:15,360
Grinding it

1081
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:21,760
Servel grinding things

1082
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:28,160
422 says the problem is here

1083
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:34,560
I guess that's that line Maybe

1084
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:40,960
Oh.

1085
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:47,360
Okay

1086
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:53,760
Yeah I had to cap to small it did not find that very well at least it doesn't think it did

1087
02:00:54,016 --> 02:01:00,160
Although you know what that's an absolute space so it maybe this is actually really good

1088
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:06,560
Let's see what the data looks like in here first

1089
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:19,360
They'll grind is for finding memory leaks right for finding memory leaks in anywhere that

1090
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:25,760
You're violating any kind of memory rule valgrind actually runs an x86 emulator and so whatever you do

1091
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:32,160
Anything with memory fell Greenville watch you like a hawk like Santa Claus

1092
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:44,960
Okay so from this thing's point-of-view that's what this date

1093
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:51,360
Looks like I'm thinking it's pretty good that's definitely the sort of thing I'd like to see what's

1094
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:57,760
I'll see what it looks like that particular camera in in voxel plastic here

1095
02:01:58,016 --> 02:02:04,160
Wi wizard says valve uses and I'll grind in house I would

1096
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:10,560
Would hope that everybody uses valgrind in-house Bell grind valgrind I don't know how to pronounce

1097
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:16,960
Ryan is cooler little grind sounds way more metal

1098
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:23,360
Totally wrong try that again not in rgba Mountain

1099
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:29,760
Oh that's not right either

1100
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:36,160
Or maybe it is

1101
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:42,560
GM says that their code was so big they couldn't even run

1102
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:48,960
Dial Brian no part of it this looks

1103
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:55,360
Super weird I don't even know what I'm looking at here

1104
02:02:55,616 --> 02:03:01,760
What is up with this

1105
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:08,160
Smoke

1106
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:14,560
Oh wait no the hmd is not in the center anymore it's pointed right at it

1107
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:20,960
Santo Que

1108
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:27,360
Why is it shouldn't be that bad that's such a large search area

1109
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:33,760
And not to mention there's two locals so there's I was really hoping

1110
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:40,160
Able to use like gradient descent or something and just find the right answer but

1111
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:46,560
Wikipedia says pronounce

1112
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:52,960
Rob if you pronounce that yourself louder

1113
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:59,360
Turn off the screen will hear you in our hearts

1114
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:05,760
I don't

1115
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:12,160
Yeah I don't know what's up with this that's very strange

1116
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:24,960
I don't know why though

1117
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:31,360
That would be I mean it's kind of right like that's kind of where it is

1118
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:37,760
Whatever

1119
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:44,160
Just curious I'm just going to try the other light house right now

1120
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:56,960
But I need to be able to drive home so no hard liquor

1121
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:09,760
The other lighthouses like I kind of have an idea store the thing like they

1122
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:16,160
Hahaha

1123
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:22,560
The other lighthouses to wear that it's you know somewhere on that side of the

1124
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:28,960
The room knows the other lighthouse

1125
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:35,360
Those that you know about that far away that's really cool that the the shape that the probability

1126
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:41,760
Kicker for the other Lighthouse makes is that nice and pretty but

1127
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:48,160
Cool ya-ha

1128
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:54,560
You may want to move your coffee table over a little because the edge of the sweet might be hitting that actually look down I put my head on

1129
02:05:54,816 --> 02:06:00,960
On the floor where the thing was and it was totally not all that is so

1130
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:07,360
Weird

1131
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:13,760
So yeah I clearly the other lighthouses not getting enough points to

1132
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:20,160
Know where it is

1133
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:26,560
Okay sorry what was the next thing that we were supposed to be doing

1134
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:32,960
I've been derailed with something Adams.

1135
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:39,360
Copy railing people let's see what the date of

1136
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:45,760
Have you been reading the article the guy posted in there

1137
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:52,160
Okay I'll see what else was actually on the original agenda so he's done that we've gotten the

1138
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:58,560
Points and the normals for the Watchmen oh no

1139
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:04,960
Anybody yet in chat found a list of the points and normals for the Watchmen

1140
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:11,360
Specific

1141
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:17,760
Specifically if anybody has access to the

1142
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:24,160
To the points and normals for the Watchman controller that would be super cool I tried

1143
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:30,560
Asking the Watchmen the nice way through the to hit interface and it totally did not tell me anything so

1144
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:36,960
Visualize the lighthouse probability Dayton voxel

1145
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:43,360
Plastic totally did that improve the Watchman disambiguate ER

1146
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:49,760
We're going to have to work on that

1147
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:56,160
And collect more data is people want it so I think the other thing some people wanted was for me to point the

1148
02:07:56,416 --> 02:08:02,560
Camera at yourself that's fine what's the point the

1149
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:08,960
Badmouth display at the other Lighthouse and see what it says so we're going to go do that right now

1150
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:15,360
Yeah there's not much left of probably you don't mind

1151
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:28,160
Face is all mine

1152
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:40,960
Glad I could share some Polish

1153
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:53,760
Couch if they were working that would work

1154
02:08:54,016 --> 02:09:00,160
Haha

1155
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:06,560
So we'll start tracking some Lighthouse David here

1156
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:12,960
So right now it's mostly pointed at the Lighthouse are and we're collecting that data

1157
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:19,360
For Christmas

1158
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:25,760
Hey crazy right I've an idea you take so many screenshots of the bloxels

1159
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:32,160
And you make a billionaire and give me $1000000 in will be set

1160
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:38,560
Crazy bread is named after a fake art dealer from Animal Crossing

1161
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:44,960
I do not have to fly any rough

1162
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:51,360
Destinations where the lighthouses are this is just purely based off of position of a word is what

1163
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:57,760
Could be okay

1164
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:04,160
Do you have to supply

1165
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:10,560
No already answered that one

1166
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:16,960
We all look like we need some adderal is there anyway

1167
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:23,360
What kind of

1168
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:29,760
Circular LED purple kind of

1169
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:36,160
Yeah in that thing is I have in in the tread I have the raw times but

1170
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:42,560
You would have to Park City to get angles back out which you could just bring camfind and then

1171
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:48,960
Get the angles from their loads in here actually

1172
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:55,360
David I will pull up him find in this thing I will walk you through it on the screen

1173
02:10:55,616 --> 02:11:01,760
Okay so inside of Cam find the first thing we do is we load data and we say either our

1174
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:08,160
Or l4r for the right camera or L4 the left camera sorry I say camera I mean lighthouse

1175
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:14,560
Okay you know what load data

1176
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:20,960
Lighthouse

1177
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:27,360
Oasis and get Havasu number 2

1178
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:33,760
Issue Number 3 Issue Number 3 is where I have a bunch of the example data at any rate so in the

1179
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:40,160
I'm fine. See I go load the data and what this does is it first at Lowe's

1180
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:46,560
All of the sorry it's down here first

1181
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:52,960
Get where is it. Is first it opens up

1182
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:59,360
Correct hmb points that CSV which is in an issue number 3 then it opens up

1183
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:05,760
H&B normals. CSV which is an issue number 3 and then it opens up whichever

1184
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:12,160
File you want to do like our and it reads out all of the lighthouse data from that file

1185
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:18,560
And only uses the our Lighthouse and it figures out the the average angles

1186
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:24,960
Of all of the photodiodes that it sees and it does that by disintegrating over the whole thing and

1187
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:31,360
Converting them into radians from text Betsy

1188
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:37,760
Taxi work pretty well the first one

1189
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:44,160
Is correct hmd points at CSV the second was hmd normals and the third one is

1190
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:50,560
The actual light data and the actual like data I posted is like the most recent thing in

1191
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:56,960
In Issue Number 3 I'm going to be posting a little bit more soon

1192
02:12:57,216 --> 02:13:03,360
Parrots talking to number our look at that data

1193
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:09,760
It's off by few millimetres but that still so much see what it says

1194
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:16,160
If I copy this data into here

1195
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:22,560
Automatic and

1196
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:28,960
Turn off apparently you're offline again thinking you look like a strung-out Kotor I am strung-out code

1197
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:35,360
I think it's the bags under the eyes cuz

1198
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:41,760
I've been up all night every night doing the stupid Lighthouse stuff

1199
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:48,160
Staring at the infrared lights pouring out of them

1200
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:54,560
Me begging the lighthouses tell me your secrets mean while Ben is just there being like

1201
02:13:54,816 --> 02:14:00,960
I put those secrets in the lighthouses

1202
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:07,360
Yeah I don't know if he's like actively in the channel right now but he did say something earlier then

1203
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:13,760
The guy who coded oh my gosh look at how gorgeous that looks over yes

1204
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:20,160
Yes yeah toad

1205
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:26,560
Yep it's right there but I think it's wrong

1206
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:32,960
Exploded maybe it's right it's

1207
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:39,360
Probably right I think it's right

1208
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:45,760
Cuz it is in the frame of reference from the whatever is the cameras point of view

1209
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:52,160
Yeah

1210
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:58,560
3 + 5 think we only need to be an issue 5 if you're talking about the controller calibrations

1211
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:04,960
That is in those space that there because the uplink

1212
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:11,360
Can't be pasted the John says he's not seen a person so obsessed of lighthouses

1213
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:17,760
Oheine are all Sony Rawls the guy who did all of the initial Lighthouse Rita

1214
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:24,160
Redox stuff which is amazingly well-documented it's almost all correct and I don't know how

1215
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:30,560
How he was able to get all of its that is truly amazing I'm so happy for his work if it weren't for his groundling work I would not have

1216
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:36,960
Even tried to do this project but I did actually try the exact same thing

1217
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:43,360
To get the data from the controllers and they don't say anything unless I have to be plugged in

1218
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:49,760
Buy USB directly to the controller do I have to do that they're all do you know if I have to be plugged in by USB to get that data

1219
02:15:56,416 --> 02:16:02,560
I also pull request

1220
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:08,960
The Ashley's things in a pull request hold on let me

1221
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:15,360
Let me get this data committed or added to the issue first

1222
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:47,360
If you're into electronic audio you should check out the things that my buddy Paul made

1223
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:53,760
Electronic

1224
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:06,560
Baker 12555 timers and pots

1225
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:12,960
Pretty impressive holding a boards generate sound they use a bunch of likes that before Gates and whatever

1226
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:25,760
Advanced still supposed to use the Internet or something with the

1227
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:32,160
I don't know if you ever finish that woman on a lot of time working on it I should show you what

1228
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:38,560
Because we're trying to do it can you guys do that later like take a note

1229
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:44,960
See here so you got you said I had

1230
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:51,360
Pull request it says pull request

1231
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:57,760
Better access

1232
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:04,160
Comma I think

1233
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:10,560
Not sure what's going on here

1234
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:16,960
Who makes l255 for

1235
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:23,360
Preach

1236
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:29,760
Sure why not let's make this the thing this looks good

1237
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:36,160
I guess sure fine whatever

1238
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:42,560
Can I merge this without hosing that file

1239
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:48,960
Know what

1240
02:18:55,616 --> 02:19:01,760
I'm going to just check out my stuff

1241
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:08,160
I don't feel like dealing with a merge right now

1242
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:14,560
So I will just accept what they have wholesale and hope for the best

1243
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:20,960
Merge pull request confirm git pull

1244
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:27,360
Can't find Ducey

1245
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:33,760
What

1246
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:40,160
Poppy can't find it oh yeah I could have done that all well

1247
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:12,160
I don't know which day does

1248
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:18,560
Set that just operated on let's just try it for Al's raw lighthouse

1249
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:24,960
Tool playing Test 2

1250
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:31,360
So interesting I have no idea what I'm looking at their like accies that come out from The Middle

1251
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:37,760
But I don't know which one is positive and negative but still pretty cool

1252
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:44,160
So which ones why and which ones X I wonder

1253
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:50,560
I only see two going like the same direction their there's this

1254
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:56,960
Other fainter wanted more I'll make it so it's easier to say

1255
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:03,360
Now I can't see it all the video actually Niceville to see it

1256
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:09,760
Yes now I can see it it's green

1257
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:22,560
Okay that's neat

1258
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:35,360
Where's the bluest left right

1259
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:41,760
I think Z is foreign backward nosy would be like this way down although wow that's a weird

1260
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:48,160
Shape

1261
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:54,560
Know what's causing that that's very strange

1262
02:21:54,816 --> 02:22:00,960
Okay point is the thing I was really really hoping that this data would just

1263
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:07,360
Charlie like converge totally not how it works

1264
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:13,760
Huh

1265
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:20,160
Okay well that's that's interesting

1266
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:26,560
Has a has neural said anything in chat about how to actually get the data from

1267
02:22:26,816 --> 02:22:32,960
From the lighthouse ashore to plugging them in I don't think anybody in life to anybody's said how to do

1268
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:39,360
That yet question more data is people want

1269
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:45,760
I'm going to need a break right now anyway. Dave

1270
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:52,160
Michael did either of you have anything you wanted to say

1271
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:58,560
Like talk about anyting

1272
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:04,960
Dave are you ready or do you want a little while longer

1273
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:11,360
Just play a an advertisement for a minute and then oh you guys wanted to know

1274
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:17,760
No Unity Technologies was

1275
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:24,160
So Unity Technologies this thing that Adam me and I are

1276
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:30,560
Teriyaki we've gotten together and we've done a number of different projects mostly commercial thank goodness

1277
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:36,960
Everything down to making a how many was it like 8,000 crosses

1278
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:43,360
5000 cross commemorative crosses for the Pope's visit to New York

1279
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:49,760
Sure they can't hear you over there

1280
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:56,160
Can you guys hear him if he's over there did you experience

1281
02:23:56,416 --> 02:24:02,560
Oh I can't do can you Adam

1282
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:08,960
Str8 so we do a lot of custom engineering work we have a meal we have a bunch of

1283
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:15,360
Just mechanical stuff that we do and we we do make arcade machines so

1284
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:21,760
See what Brandon

1285
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:28,160
See if I searched that I can find a good

1286
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:34,560
Also like the newest game that we we made and word vide

1287
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:40,960
Debuted at Napa was the world's fastest drummer and this one is

1288
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:47,360
Italian conjunction with the fun company in a few other groups and it's just a game where you have to

1289
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:53,760
Kdramas fast as possible left and right and you have to alternate and Vie for the best best score of the day month

1290
02:24:54,016 --> 02:25:00,160
Xcetera arcades or anything like that

1291
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:06,560
World's fastest drummer we did unit if sorry we did neon FM

1292
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:12,960
Which is a video game that's like

1293
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:19,360
Stand-up arcade we have us and I'll we work with andamiro very large Korean distributor

1294
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:25,760
Are Korean manufacturer and game company on the the Korean

1295
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:32,160
Version of the arcade cab just some of the things that we do up at Unity Adam of anything else so we also do

1296
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:38,560
Custom Signs so anything involving ws2812 or other Innovative lighting stuff

1297
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:44,960
We totally mess with anything else you guys wanted to know or anyting Adam you can think of unity wise that we should mention

1298
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:51,360
And by the way you guys can totally take it as a hint there is a reason why

1299
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:57,760
They got me an HTC Vive

1300
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:04,160
Okay I need

1301
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:10,560
I need a brief break I'm just going to keep that scrolling

1302
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:16,960
I will plan ad I think I have a button to phone

1303
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:23,360
Right there and I'm curious

1304
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:36,160
I guess I'll leave it Ron not hurting anything

1305
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:42,560
Caramel popcorn

1306
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:48,960
14 minutes that's why it's not

1307
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:55,360
OK Google everything's fine

1308
02:26:55,616 --> 02:27:01,760
How long is your ad

1309
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:08,160
Why would you have YouTube okay to be fair I'm really glad you YouTube Red people

1310
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:14,560
Because I make like it's like 10 times or more I think it is purview off of YouTube Red views than I do

1311
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:20,960
You off of Regular YouTube views with ads

1312
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:27,360
I don't think we need any intern this summer we have had interns in the past and it worked out really well I would never turn down into

1313
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:33,760
Adam we consider you as an intern just apply though reply email us in a fly

1314
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:40,160
Do you guys have any did you want to mention like some stuff you were

1315
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:46,560
Working on and maybe if this would be of interest to you or like if anybody else who's interested in the vibe stuff would be

1316
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:52,960
Then I can just talk about what I was doing really briefly and how it's time release today

1317
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:59,360
Vibe stuff

1318
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:18,560
Sowell Charles are taking a quick break here I figured I could talk about my project with the Bible little bit see if everybody

1319
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:24,960
I was interested in working with my university University Maryland Baltimore County

1320
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:31,360
This spring so I've spent yesterday also went there

1321
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:37,760
Been working on a research project related to the HTC Vive where were you

1322
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:44,160
To perform human studies about reaction times

1323
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:50,560
And how people react in different situations so what we're doing right now is

1324
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:56,960
Simple pilot study to make sure that we can use it in this capacity and I programmed

1325
02:28:57,216 --> 02:29:03,360
Basic shooting range simulation in unity with two types of targets

1326
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:09,760
One you're supposed to shoot one of the sister. Shoot and the goal of the study is to see

1327
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:16,160
After explaining the tasks that allow him to take it once comparing a control group who just takes the test again

1328
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:22,560
Yan vs a group who is trained on how to better take the test

1329
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:28,960
How to avoid shooting the wrong targets to see under stress

1330
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:35,360
Situation how they respond and see if we can measure differences in their abilities to perform

1331
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:41,760
Through data gathered from the by while they're taking the mother taking it

1332
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:48,160
Trials it's been to record information about the position data of the headset

1333
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:54,560
Mission Ada of the controller as well as every time they shoot when the targets appear and disappear

1334
02:29:54,816 --> 02:30:00,960
As well as would be taking physiological data on each participant such as EG heart rate and breathing

1335
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:07,360
And after that our goal is just to make sure that we

1336
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:13,760
We get good data out of this project and see where we can go from there there's a lot of other studies were

1337
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:20,160
We're interested in but we need to make sure that is possible in first

1338
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:32,960
So

1339
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:39,360
Even when you're sober you don't understand how much have you been drinking

1340
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:45,760
Even when I'm sober implies quite a bit of drinking

1341
02:30:46,016 --> 02:30:52,160
Are you the are you do anything I want to talk that's okay

1342
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:58,560
Yeah my study is still were waiting on approval

1343
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:04,960
So we haven't really done any test subject data collection yet so I don't have too much to say about that

1344
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:11,360
Portable study involves inducing stress through

1345
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:17,760
Shocks so we have to wait until all the people who go and make

1346
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:24,160
Not doing horrible things to other people approve us

1347
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:30,560
PVCs

1348
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:43,360
So what was that

1349
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:49,760
There was a similar

1350
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:56,160
Someone did a fan experiment involving tdcs tdcs okay

1351
02:31:56,416 --> 02:32:02,560
Know what that is

1352
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:08,960
Brendan speak loudly

1353
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:15,360
What would you like the perfect intern to do

1354
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:21,760
I think that's a human at UPS

1355
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:28,160
No that's not a question I can never answer because I never know what I'm going to do it changes very routine

1356
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:34,560
Family Unity. A lot of stuff so the the definition of a interns job changed

1357
02:32:34,816 --> 02:32:40,960
Considerably from David hey I just don't understand how people can Define their jobs cuz I like

1358
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:47,360
Never known is just figure out what the heck to do all right

1359
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:53,760
Oh okay yes I actually I do remember reading about that study Michael

1360
02:32:54,016 --> 02:33:00,160
They did a thing where they were stimulating the brain trying to induce stress

1361
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:06,560
Ours is similar but it's a bit different in that we're trying to weed

1362
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:12,960
We already know that I method will induce stress but we're trying to study is Ken we train people

1363
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:19,360
Through using the EEG data and the the game of the simulation can we

1364
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:25,760
Train people to improve the response and their ability to operate properly in a

1365
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:32,160
Stressful situation or to inhibit responses that they become a b**** waited to when they're stressed

1366
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:51,360
All the people on GitHub

1367
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:57,760
This is the internet you are who you say you are until you prove otherwise

1368
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:16,960
Not sure what you mean by a god helmet

1369
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:23,360
I think probably something that involves us mic button

1370
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:29,760
CK one

1371
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:36,160
Maybe it's a collector's item but other than that I can't see what

1372
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:42,560
PS4

1373
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:48,960
Okay so they were trying almost the opposite of

1374
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:55,360
Trying to induce stress through the immersion that stimulating to reduce it okay

1375
02:34:55,616 --> 02:35:01,760
Yeah what we're doing is not quite

1376
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:08,160
Extreme as anti pedophilia training

1377
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:14,560
Somebody mentioned that what I was doing sound similar to the method they used to

1378
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:20,960
To use to Frame data files to not look at children

1379
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:27,360
Here's a kid here's an electric shock

1380
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:33,760
Proletarian dictatorship

1381
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:40,160
Robotic overlords they are coming but first we will be the overlords

1382
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:46,560
Robots that have taken our jobs

1383
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:52,960
Jobs

1384
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:59,360
Whatever you want Davis radio

1385
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:05,760
Any more questions about anything that I've done 90 it's not a whole lot yet but Dave actually has some stuff that he likes

1386
02:36:06,016 --> 02:36:12,160
Speak about as well

1387
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:18,560
So for this project we are trying to minimize the total number of

1388
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:24,960
Dependencies on anything external so that's for a few reasons one because the reason this

1389
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:31,360
Project started to begin with is because I ran out of data on my cell phone plan trying to get all the dependencies

1390
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:37,760
For the osr vosper Libre Vive Library tours

1391
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:44,160
Run which was annoying but more importantly in the long run this is really kind of targeted

1392
02:36:44,416 --> 02:36:50,560
More towards the esp32 so we really need to use is lightweight and has minimal

1393
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:56,960
Like Library stuff is we can in order to keep everything moving slowly or moving smoothly on his

1394
02:36:57,216 --> 02:37:03,360
As many processors and targets as we can so one of the things David's been doing is in order to the cabin filter we

1395
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:09,760
Have to invert matrices and notary in for matrices there's a bunch of operations you have to do to do that and

1396
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:16,160
A lot of people use lapok and that's not

1397
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:22,560
Open that was kind of quite work for us because of some of that the size and additional things surrounding it so Dave is going to be

1398
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:28,960
Speak a little bit about what his his effort has been and in case you guys could use some of what he use he's produced now

1399
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:35,360
You guys can just go check that out of the live revive Repository

1400
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:41,760
Charles has

1401
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:48,160
Talk is incredibly easy to install and Lennox the the packaging before the appearance of acne

1402
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:54,560
Has been around for 70 years

1403
02:37:54,816 --> 02:38:00,960
Fortran

1404
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:07,360
Problem was that I try to install talk back

1405
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:13,760
I'm a Macbook and there were all these dependencies

1406
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:20,160
Which I was I was surprised by you know I didn't you just say yum install or after install

1407
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:26,560
And I'll have my powers and installed over and

1408
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:32,960
Make mountains calling and I actually have to write your own

1409
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:45,760
Which did havilah Potter package but it depended on a lot of other

1410
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:52,160
And I couldn't actually get it to work so I won't up

1411
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:58,560
Rewriting one of the numerical code do I use Lu decomposition

1412
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:04,960
Which was an inventor named Alan Turing

1413
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:11,360
So you know this is America codes

1414
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:17,760
In history did Alan Turing is an algorithm which was developed

1415
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:24,160
Incredible mathematician astronomer inventor name that I call friends of gout

1416
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:30,560
All right so this is a very classical thing to do

1417
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:36,960
For me it was kind of fun to be able to take a step back and try to implement a

1418
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:43,360
Classical algorithm now one of the things code

1419
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:49,760
But we're dealing with 36 by 36 matrices and unless we find a better way

1420
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:56,160
Of of working with it and 36 by 36 major season.

1421
02:39:56,416 --> 02:40:02,560
The code that I wrote invert those at about twenty thousand Hertz or so on

1422
02:40:02,816 --> 02:40:08,960
Mac that there's a few

1423
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:15,360
Can people hear what I'm saying

1424
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:21,760
I was looking at the okay okay

1425
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:28,160
Better basically I was the one I was

1426
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:34,560
Working on rewriting a linear algebra package because I couldn't install

1427
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:40,960
Call apak which has been around for 67 years or least I couldn't install

1428
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:47,360
Saw that on a Mac because of dependencies and there isn't really a whole lot of support for which really really surprise me

1429
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:53,760
I'm so one of the things that I wanted this code to be is is really really really fast

1430
02:40:54,016 --> 02:41:00,160
And one of the things I was little bit concerned about has to do with

1431
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:06,560
All the way that see handles pointers compared to Fortran so C

1432
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:12,960
C is is doesn't have the same kind of bow

1433
02:41:13,216 --> 02:41:19,360
Tyler doesn't know as much if you have a b and c and if you're reading from pointer a

1434
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:25,760
And writing to pointer be and you're in a weaving these operations the compiler doesn't know

1435
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:32,160
Know that you're writing to be isn't going to affect the reading for May so that can slow the compile

1436
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:38,560
Tyler down if it has to wait for that right to finish inferred that reads

1437
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:44,960
Finish it they could introduce additional stalls to way out of being conservative doesn't know if you're riding this memory

1438
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:51,360
How do I know that doesn't affect that other memory right so CC Fortran knows that these are arrays he doesn't know that

1439
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:57,760
So I'll one thing that I did with this library was that I made everything in macros

1440
02:41:58,016 --> 02:42:04,160
Rather than using functions I'm so by putting everything in macros the compiler

1441
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:10,560
I don't have to pass a pointer the compiler can actually see where I put the local variable I'm so

1442
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:16,960
At least think that it should be able to optimize more aggressively then if

1443
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:23,360
I had written a function that had to pass data through a pointer now lud compass

1444
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:29,760
Position is where you do row reduction effect

1445
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:36,160
You think you can help...

1446
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:42,560
Composition to convert your Matrix

1447
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:48,960
Into what's called a lower triangular and an upper triangular forms if he's

1448
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:55,360
Scroll down might be able to see some examples of a lower triangular on upper triangular Matrix

1449
02:42:55,616 --> 02:43:01,760
That I just said that those blocks of matrices there you see that

1450
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:08,160
The one in the left is your original matric say that you try to invert the Y

1451
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:14,560
One in the middle is a lower triangular Matrix and the one on the right is an upper

1452
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:20,960
Triangular Matrix so for those of you that have taken linear algebra the first thing you had

1453
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:27,360
Why do was row reduction so I Matrix is a system of equations and

1454
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:33,760
And how do you solve for two equations into a non 12 you could use a substitution method if you can solve for 1

1455
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:40,160
Variable you can substitute that another but matrices usually what people use are

1456
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:46,560
You would multiply your equation you would do would multiply constant by one of your equations and

1457
02:43:46,816 --> 02:43:52,960
Add that to the other one so that some of your charms cancel out so by putting it into this

1458
02:43:53,216 --> 02:43:59,360
Upper triangular form that you have on the very right most Matrix if you had an upper triangular Matrix and

1459
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:05,760
And you wanted to solve for a vector product the very last row

1460
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:12,160
I had only one term so you can actually solve for the last if if you want an upper

1461
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:18,560
Triangular Matrix X XYZ well you know you can solve for Z directly

1462
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:24,960
You know that what is it you 22 x e is equal to 2 BC

1463
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:31,360
Besa Besa see you could just you know that that has only one term you can solve for that one

1464
02:44:31,616 --> 02:44:37,760
Once you have that one term you can plug that into the middle equation cuz you have

1465
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:44,160
Have two terms and two unknowns but you already have one you've already solved for this and I can solve for y

1466
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:50,560
And then what you have why you can plug that Y and Z into the first equation and then the only unknown you have

1467
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:56,960
Abba sex so you can you can you can solve for

1468
02:44:57,216 --> 02:45:03,360
You can solve a system of equations if it's an upper triangular form so by having a lower triangular and an upper

1469
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:09,760
Triangular you can you can solve a system of equations using the upper triangular using what's called

1470
02:45:10,016 --> 02:45:16,160
Back substitution and then take that result and plug it into the lower triangular using Ford

1471
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:22,560
Actually have to plug into the lower in the cold

1472
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:28,960
The code I can see why accept the plug it into the lower triangular Matrix first and then take that result and plug it into the upper trying

1473
02:45:29,216 --> 02:45:35,360
Regular Matrix but the other thing so

1474
02:45:35,616 --> 02:45:41,760
By doing the decomposition I was a question

1475
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:48,160
Inversions over what time period by what metric well I took the Matrix of the problem size

1476
02:45:48,416 --> 02:45:54,560
Guys that were interested in because he had to make it by relevant and I ran it in a loop

1477
02:45:54,816 --> 02:46:00,960
And I ran it in a loop of 10000 times and it ran in about

1478
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:07,359
I have a second so so that that would mean that the Matrix inverse

1479
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:13,759
InStep which is usually the most expensive operation in the common filter that that stuff and I

1480
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:20,159
Isolation is plenty fast enough or at least it should be more than more

1481
02:46:20,415 --> 02:46:26,559
Enough for what we need to be able to use it for I haven't tried running this on very

1482
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:32,959
Very large matrices I mean I tried running it on a 50 x 50 and yeah it looks at you know if you if you invert The Matrix

1483
02:46:33,215 --> 02:46:39,359
And multiply the inverse X original Matrix you get the identity so they know that's that's a good sign

1484
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:45,759
Another thing about row reduction if you go into the code

1485
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:52,159
The inversion function so well

1486
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:58,559
If you look at the inversion function it defines a few matrices there and then it calls

1487
02:46:58,815 --> 02:47:04,959
It has a few steps to create an identity Matrix

1488
02:47:05,215 --> 02:47:11,359
I am going to calls Lu and LU is the Lu decomposition so that's the most important one

1489
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:17,759
I'm in that led composition are you actually it's not until you decomposition of Domaine

1490
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:24,159
Matrix a it's an Lu decomposition of the Matrix a with some of the Rose interchanged and the reason why

1491
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:30,559
I want to Interchange Rose is that if you just do row reduction you know the way they taught you in school you my taxes

1492
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:36,959
Currently have two divided by a very small number if one of those

1493
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:43,359
Entries is close to zero and you try to / it then it could be numerically unstable

1494
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:49,759
So if you swap the order of the Rose you can make sure that you're always dividing by a large number so that you don't

1495
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:56,159
So that you don't have any numerical problems like that and then what you see is it it does forward substitution into the elm

1496
02:47:56,415 --> 02:48:02,559
Matrix and then it goes back substitution of the umatrix and that's

1497
02:48:02,815 --> 02:48:08,959
The that is the Matrix inverse so it's it's it's really really

1498
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:15,359
Not that hard when you look at it from that high-level but if you look at the L U decomposition code that's a bunch of

1499
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:21,759
That's that's above and that's a bunch of four loops and it looks very similar I've looked at the Fortran code

1500
02:48:22,015 --> 02:48:28,159
I I can't write in Fortran but it looks pretty similar to the way people do it and it looks kind of like a

1501
02:48:28,415 --> 02:48:34,559
Especially since the macro I don't know that you can put comments in macros I would have loved to put High usually put comments in my code

1502
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:40,959
Function that you really should consider writing them and function yeah but I want

1503
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:47,359
Wanted the compiler to have all of the hints that it could possibly have

1504
02:48:47,615 --> 02:48:53,759
In terms of the way the memory is laid out so that it can make it really fast

1505
02:48:54,015 --> 02:49:00,159
So

1506
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:06,559
No I just I didn't have a copy of the function in front of me

1507
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:12,959
Give me just a second

1508
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:19,359
Not one I do intend at least on x86 to the dino compiling with

1509
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:25,759
Beaufort and AVX and even on this old processor right here

1510
02:49:26,015 --> 02:49:32,159
So it's going to automatically do a lot of the Cindy and you say no it won't compilers are terrible at

1511
02:49:32,415 --> 02:49:38,559
That's wrong because I just totally of like written a bunch of test program to do some pretty like like screwed up things

1512
02:49:38,815 --> 02:49:44,959
And the compiler can still figure it out and still like totally paralyzed the heck out of it so

1513
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:51,359
I am thoroughly impressed with everything past GCC for it just figures out this automatic factorization

1514
02:49:51,615 --> 02:49:57,759
Totally Cindy's it exactly right better than I can do it this time and I'm like I love assembly

1515
02:49:58,015 --> 02:50:04,159
Did you guys hear what I said clearly

1516
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:10,559
Oh no okay

1517
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:16,959
Do you guys hear me clear enough or do I need to go back Charles was basically saying that g

1518
02:50:17,215 --> 02:50:23,359
Gc4u compiled with the dash 04 flag should figure out automatic vectorization

1519
02:50:23,615 --> 02:50:29,759
And he said he's tested on some programs and he thought the compiler wouldn't be able to vectorize and it was able to do

1520
02:50:30,015 --> 02:50:36,159
Do so so I haven't seen it

1521
02:50:36,415 --> 02:50:42,559
Only but Charles is is giving us his word that it

1522
02:50:42,815 --> 02:50:48,959
Rise of the code and I tried to write the code in a way that the compiler would have as much information

1523
02:50:49,215 --> 02:50:55,359
Is it possibly could to optimize aggressively but I don't know that it's really

1524
02:50:55,615 --> 02:51:01,759
Play necessary by I think the performance is fast enough so

1525
02:51:02,015 --> 02:51:08,159
Hopefully we can compile it I even out if the computer doesn't have gtc4 and it would run

1526
02:51:08,415 --> 02:51:14,559
It would it would run plenty fast and if it does have GCC for that it should run even even even more

1527
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:20,959
Even you know more even faster right so so

1528
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:27,359
Yeah sometimes you have to oh yeah we were looking at

1529
02:51:27,615 --> 02:51:33,759
The goal is to eventually actually get it to run on this little guy right here

1530
02:51:34,015 --> 02:51:40,159
He does not have Cindy instructions esp32 does have a floating-point unit

1531
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:46,559
Gold is get it running on there eventually and you'll see why

1532
02:51:46,815 --> 02:51:52,959
This case that a regular computer is someday hopefully

1533
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:59,359
So so so the Lu function there's really two parts to it there's that there's this

1534
02:51:59,615 --> 02:52:05,759
Giant for-loop I guess it's about here that's it that's that's going

1535
02:52:06,015 --> 02:52:12,159
Going for every row and then this part this first part over here has to figure out

1536
02:52:12,415 --> 02:52:18,559
Rearranging the the the rose because we don't want to divide

1537
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:24,959
I'd buy a small number so we find the largest number to / and that's that's called a pivot table

1538
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:31,359
I'm in and that's something that you have to do with LED composition to make sure that it's numeric

1539
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:37,759
Stable and then this

1540
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:44,159
I don't think I'll even be 5 minutes and then this part here is actually

1541
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:50,559
Doing the division and the thing is that

1542
02:52:50,815 --> 02:52:56,959
You have to take a row and a figure out how much to multiply in add it to that

1543
02:52:57,215 --> 02:53:03,359
A Robalo it cancels out to the first term cancels out 20 that's that's that's

1544
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:09,759
That's for the row reduction and that's how you calculate the upper triangular Matrix but then the law

1545
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:16,159
Lower triangular Matrix right it has to be you have to have lower * upper

1546
02:53:16,415 --> 02:53:22,559
A but you know what you're actually doing when you do that operation that you're taking a

1547
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:28,959
When you're multiplying a buy something so you're actually you're you're saying something kind

1548
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:35,359
Is a is equal to is equal to you so you have to you have

1549
02:53:35,615 --> 02:53:41,759
If you kind of set up those two equations on

1550
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:48,159
Piece of paper you can figure out okay well there's something slightly different times.you is equal to a minced

1551
02:53:48,415 --> 02:53:54,559
Set of something * 8 is equal to you so it turns out that all you have

1552
02:53:54,815 --> 02:54:00,959
Have to do is hear I set the L4 the

1553
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:07,359
Iji term equal to scale which is you suggest

1554
02:54:07,615 --> 02:54:13,759
5 / use of II

1555
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:20,159
Just have to be careful about it and the other thing I have to be careful when you swap the order

1556
02:54:20,415 --> 02:54:26,559
Hours of the of the rows and columns and a that you swap the order of the same Rose in LA

1557
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:32,959
And in you not just one or the other on those were a couple snacks that I got into but

1558
02:54:33,215 --> 02:54:39,359
So yeah if if if if I had a

1559
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:45,759
Package that was working for me on the computer I wanted to use straight out of the box that could have saved me

1560
02:54:46,015 --> 02:54:52,159
Sometime but I think this was a nice little exercise and again it was a step backward but

1561
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:58,559
We're preparing to make the big step forward so yeah that's that's

1562
02:54:58,815 --> 02:55:04,959
That's all I got any other questions for for Dave right now or

1563
02:55:05,215 --> 02:55:11,359
Any more questions for Dave right now keep in mind that this is the sort of thing that you'll be at

1564
02:55:11,615 --> 02:55:17,759
Able to use on other projects and whatnot because all of this is going to be licensed under the MIT X11

1565
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:24,159
Yeah it's it's 200 lines of code and it's probably the easiest

1566
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:30,559
Is to install one header file Matrix library that you could probably find to copy on any

1567
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:36,959
Everybody if NFL are bugs in please fix something that's intimate but

1568
02:55:37,215 --> 02:55:43,359
Yeah we have not instituted yet

1569
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:49,759
Strict I promise to include patches with all bug report policy yet but I hope we do

1570
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:56,159
Don't have to go there for you if you don't know if you it back in the day to use the experimental versions of the compiler GCC

1571
02:55:56,415 --> 02:56:02,559
You would actually have to pound to find a thing where you said I promise to include patches

1572
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:08,959
With all bug reports to fix the bugs that you're reporting okay

1573
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:15,359
Back to business so has anybody in chat yet figured out how

1574
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:21,759
How to actually get the anybody in chat yet figured out how to get

1575
02:56:22,015 --> 02:56:28,159
The data for the normals and positions of the photodiodes on the Watchmen

1576
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:34,559
And I see that narrow has reported that it's there

1577
02:56:34,815 --> 02:56:40,959
But I just don't know how to get it cuz I did try running it against it and it just did not give it to me

1578
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:47,359
I'm looking right now I guess we use the lighthouse console

1579
02:56:47,615 --> 02:56:53,759
We can't do that just the fiber has to run entirely without that

1580
02:57:00,415 --> 02:57:06,559
I think arresting them I never heard of the mamora corrected

1581
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:12,959
Files what is that

1582
02:57:13,215 --> 02:57:19,359
What is this identified hmd open the Chase on filing it started its data

1583
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:25,759
I don't know what the the Murrah correction data what is the ma

1584
02:57:26,015 --> 02:57:32,159
Correction data oh my gosh what is that that is a

1585
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:38,559
A really dense picture calibration

1586
02:57:38,815 --> 02:57:44,959
Fashionphile whoa I totally do not know what is going on there

1587
02:57:45,215 --> 02:57:51,359
We are going to have to add that to the to-do list to learn about won the war

1588
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:57,759
World is does that mean okay I have never heard of it

1589
02:57:58,015 --> 02:58:04,159
I've seen the thing in my config but what is up with the Mariah Carey

1590
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:10,559
Direction stuff that looks Wicked

1591
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:16,959
Do it for Pixel brightness calibration cool

1592
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:29,759
That's really going to be something that would be a problem for me then cuz I want

1593
02:58:30,015 --> 02:58:36,159
Wanted to do I was hoping to do all of the correction for the lens stuff in

1594
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:42,559
In a Vertex Shader and do everything in one pass instead of rendering to a texture and then rendering the text route to the sky

1595
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:48,959
Scream that's really hoping to avoid that cuz I am working on the bottom

1596
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:55,359
Intel integrated graphics

1597
02:58:55,615 --> 02:59:01,759
That the image coronavirus passed through almost I think that's what they're saying so so mi casa

1598
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:08,159
Sing that basically the Murrah correction this thing here is a filter that the Vive like all the data being pass

1599
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:14,559
The vibe is passing through before it gets displayed I don't know if that's actually the case but that's

1600
02:59:14,815 --> 02:59:20,959
Yeah yeah

1601
02:59:21,215 --> 02:59:27,359
I would definitely make sense if that's what's going on I don't know that that's what's going on but that I would totally buy it

1602
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:33,759
Has a correction for the

1603
02:59:34,015 --> 02:59:40,159
An OLED display I didn't actually Rises name LED display I thought it was an LCD display but it makes sense

1604
02:59:40,415 --> 02:59:46,559
Susan AMOLED cuz it's no there faster and all

1605
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:52,959
I don't actually know where the png's are store cuz I do know when I wiped out the configuration on my

1606
02:59:53,215 --> 02:59:59,359
Candy did not wipe out the the things

1607
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:05,759
Jordan HMV maybe I'll figure out a way to extract it sooner or later certainly I didn't

1608
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:12,159
Not accidentally blow it away though thank goodness

1609
03:00:12,415 --> 03:00:18,559
Rob everybody don't just linked articles Dallas like a brief summary

1610
03:00:18,815 --> 03:00:24,959
I'll look at it okay Mike's going to look at that

1611
03:00:25,215 --> 03:00:31,359
Okay so anybody have any

1612
03:00:31,615 --> 03:00:37,759
Any idea how to extract and see what are these controllers there is a Json file for this other person

1613
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:44,159
Controller that looks pretty cool

1614
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:50,559
Basically they want to come over here and explain

1615
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:56,959
So thank you rob for the link I was just reading about it and it says that they

1616
03:00:57,215 --> 03:01:03,359
Basically Motocross Action is a system that came up with to level out the income

1617
03:01:03,615 --> 03:01:09,759
Consistencies in the scream they're using inside of the Vive cuz each pixel would have varying Brighton

1618
03:01:10,015 --> 03:01:16,159
Ness even just buy a little bit but when it's that close to your face and with the

1619
03:01:16,415 --> 03:01:22,559
The lenses on it it becomes a pretty drastic difference once you actually level that out and get a consistent imagefirst

1620
03:01:22,815 --> 03:01:28,959
One with that variance in it the it helps with

1621
03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:35,359
Both Clarity of you and with trying to even out what you're looking at so

1622
03:01:35,615 --> 03:01:41,759
So that you're not drawn to one area over another or distorting the image of the colors

1623
03:01:42,015 --> 03:01:48,159
So that's basically all the Merida

1624
03:01:48,415 --> 03:01:54,559
But it was not discussed how Miraak reaction was achieved but looking at this it looks like it's

1625
03:01:54,815 --> 03:02:00,959
Moore Hardware oriented the files stored on the hmd so

1626
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:07,359
Show me software you implemented in software

1627
03:02:07,615 --> 03:02:13,759
Applying to the fragment Shader stuff it looks like

1628
03:02:14,015 --> 03:02:20,159
Restored in the hmd and would be used by the CPU door by the GPU in the fragment Shader step before. Puts

1629
03:02:20,415 --> 03:02:26,559
The picture to that the thingy it's basically just the last thing that

1630
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:32,959
Needs to be done to the image so that it can even it out before it gets displayed

1631
03:02:46,015 --> 03:02:52,159
The rest of the stuff in that article is pre-release or

1632
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:58,559
Early stuff

1633
03:02:58,815 --> 03:03:04,959
Yeah okay so nothing so does anybody else have any idea

1634
03:03:05,215 --> 03:03:11,359
He has about how I'm going to go get the data from the controllers or anything I just need to plug them in and try to hold off that way cuz we can't use

1635
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:17,759
The steam tools to pull the data from the various subsystems

1636
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:24,159
Amy accidentally

1637
03:03:24,415 --> 03:03:30,559
Do I will go run that on the other ones and we'll take a look and see what it it says

1638
03:03:30,815 --> 03:03:36,959
So if I go back over to here

1639
03:03:37,215 --> 03:03:43,359
Close this out

1640
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:49,759
Yeah yeah we can't we can't use steam Cool Tools because we have to be able to run

1641
03:03:50,015 --> 03:03:56,159
On Independence of the steam tools

1642
03:04:09,215 --> 03:04:15,359
So right here is a load config and I pull it from stay like that

1643
03:04:15,615 --> 03:04:21,759
Headset, if I wanted to say pulled from the watch and 0

1644
03:04:22,015 --> 03:04:28,159
I can pass it in a different stud device ID and then go from there but that doesn't work so if I say

1645
03:04:28,415 --> 03:04:34,559
They make and I power on the Watchmen this time

1646
03:04:34,815 --> 03:04:40,959
And the other one to let me try

1647
03:04:41,215 --> 03:04:47,359
Running this it just doesn't work

1648
03:04:47,615 --> 03:04:53,759
Could not get a survive config

1649
03:04:54,015 --> 03:05:00,159
Off of device 20 device 30

1650
03:05:00,415 --> 03:05:06,559
Could knock it off 30 and I have 40 installed nope just cannot get the data

1651
03:05:06,815 --> 03:05:12,959
Tried a couple of other combinations and there's just no way of

1652
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:19,359
Getting it off

1653
03:05:19,615 --> 03:05:25,759
That is ridiculous you should just buy a Vive

1654
03:05:26,015 --> 03:05:32,159
807

1655
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:38,559
So

1656
03:05:38,815 --> 03:05:44,959
Taylor looks like a look at Moody just open the one

1657
03:05:45,215 --> 03:05:51,359
Basically the biggest thing I've got with the life right now is the fact that nobody's willing to I already Set It Off

1658
03:05:51,615 --> 03:05:57,759
Nobody's willing to put forth the resources on a AAA game because it's a $700 peripheral basic

1659
03:05:58,015 --> 03:06:04,159
Yeah the marketshare just isn't there yet for the resources of the AAA game

1660
03:06:04,415 --> 03:06:10,559
And a lot of people are waiting for 5 to point out

1661
03:06:10,815 --> 03:06:16,959
It's there myself and get replaced every year where this where's the new vibe

1662
03:06:17,215 --> 03:06:23,359
Why have I forgotten didn't hear

1663
03:06:23,615 --> 03:06:29,759
Whoops

1664
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:36,159
Some of us live in the house together Adam and Brendan live here

1665
03:06:36,415 --> 03:06:42,559
And Mike and Dave do not currently live here

1666
03:06:42,815 --> 03:06:48,959
Florian we do not currently have access to a good 3D printer we have friends who have access

1667
03:06:49,215 --> 03:06:55,359
Okay 3D printers but

1668
03:06:55,615 --> 03:07:01,759
Mike says he has a sort of decent 3D printer

1669
03:07:02,015 --> 03:07:08,159
Get config that's to find here I think yes

1670
03:07:08,415 --> 03:07:14,559
Silence I say he'd get feature report timeout and I passing the ice

1671
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:20,959
My face and then definitely definitely comes from like CTX tab so that would be

1672
03:07:21,215 --> 03:07:27,359
See where those setup

1673
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:33,759
Case I guess that would actually be in our face

1674
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:40,159
0 C what would that be

1675
03:07:40,415 --> 03:07:46,559
Message from one that can't be right

1676
03:07:53,215 --> 03:07:59,359
Sirius watch and want to watch them to or 2 and 31 in the world why is it getting it from the iff lighthouse interface

1677
03:07:59,615 --> 03:08:05,759
Death Lighthouse that's just weird

1678
03:08:18,815 --> 03:08:24,959
So it is actually to sew to his word should be reading it from

1679
03:08:25,215 --> 03:08:31,359
So if I try reading it directly from the Watchmen nothing happens

1680
03:08:31,615 --> 03:08:37,759
Nothing

1681
03:08:38,015 --> 03:08:44,159
So let's see here

1682
03:09:16,415 --> 03:09:22,559
Open that device that context

1683
03:09:22,815 --> 03:09:28,959
Yeah just can't get the config

1684
03:09:29,215 --> 03:09:35,359
I guess I could add something to be able to pull it from the

1685
03:09:35,615 --> 03:09:41,759
Why wouldn't it be able to pull that

1686
03:09:42,015 --> 03:09:48,159
That way though maybe it's hiding on the

1687
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:54,559
Anybody has any ideas here I'd be really really grateful

1688
03:10:14,015 --> 03:10:20,159
I'm just

1689
03:10:20,415 --> 03:10:26,559
Shooting in the dark

1690
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:39,359
I'm just going to try to pull from all the things

1691
03:10:39,615 --> 03:10:45,759
It's a 40 cuz I already know that one works

1692
03:10:46,015 --> 03:10:52,159
Oh

1693
03:10:52,415 --> 03:10:58,559
Rob suggested treating the pixels is signed and subtract 128

1694
03:10:58,815 --> 03:11:04,959
Pixels are mostly gray because it's a median

1695
03:11:05,215 --> 03:11:11,359
Man why do we have to pull up the more stuff I can't have you guys distractions with that

1696
03:11:11,615 --> 03:11:17,759
I got to figure out how to get the Watchmen data once it so the other reason when I get to watch bendita is cuz I think if we play

1697
03:11:18,015 --> 03:11:24,159
PlayTube these into places in the room will be able to try to narrow down where the lighthouses are

1698
03:11:24,415 --> 03:11:30,559
By trying to solve simultaneous system of equations to determine like is that and that really a valid play

1699
03:11:30,815 --> 03:11:36,959
Place for those two lighthouses where would they probably be if the the two were to match up to the controllers

1700
03:12:34,815 --> 03:12:40,959
Yep looks like another devices

1701
03:12:41,215 --> 03:12:47,359
From 12 to 100 show anyting

1702
03:13:00,415 --> 03:13:06,559
Pinterest

1703
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:12,959
At what the actual distance between your lighthouses was

1704
03:13:19,615 --> 03:13:25,759
I mean if it's been three years to the headset diagonally

1705
03:13:26,015 --> 03:13:32,159
Which is the 18th to check hey

1706
03:13:32,415 --> 03:13:38,559
Interesting too much data on packet from config device 0250

1707
03:13:38,815 --> 03:13:44,959
Sex therapist exactly 16 ft

1708
03:13:45,215 --> 03:13:48,031
I mean they're working fine so

1709
03:14:51,775 --> 03:14:53,823
A killer clown

1710
03:14:58,943 --> 03:15:03,295
Actually guys if you want we can try this microphone for a bit how do you

1711
03:15:03,807 --> 03:15:04,831
How do you like this one

1712
03:15:06,879 --> 03:15:09,951
FIFA some Works any better taxi in the webcam

1713
03:15:16,095 --> 03:15:17,119
Too much data

1714
03:15:17,631 --> 03:15:22,751
On packet from config for device 00c what is it saying

1715
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:31,967
Shabbos

1716
03:15:46,047 --> 03:15:47,839
135

1717
03:15:50,655 --> 03:15:52,191
Is that valid

1718
03:15:56,799 --> 03:15:58,079
That might be valid

1719
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:19,071
So 135 what happens if I just make this

1720
03:16:19,327 --> 03:16:19,839
Figure

1721
03:16:21,375 --> 03:16:22,655
Can we actually read that

1722
03:16:29,311 --> 03:16:32,127
Let's see what the data coming back from the devices

1723
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:49,023
That's

1724
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:50,303
Something

1725
03:16:52,863 --> 03:16:53,375
That's

1726
03:16:53,887 --> 03:16:55,167
Definitely something

1727
03:16:55,679 --> 03:16:59,775
But that does not look like configuration day and it looks much more like settings data

1728
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:03,871
Ha

1729
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:07,967
Not sure what's going on there

1730
03:17:20,255 --> 03:17:25,119
Don't think there's anywhere else I can load config data from I'm not sure what's up with oh hey

1731
03:17:25,375 --> 03:17:27,935
Bacon caramel popcorn

1732
03:17:37,407 --> 03:17:39,199
Internet

1733
03:17:39,711 --> 03:17:43,039
Do you want this wonderful baking caramel popcorn

1734
03:17:43,295 --> 03:17:45,855
It's amazing you can't have it

1735
03:17:48,927 --> 03:17:52,255
You just totally blew somebody's mind.

1736
03:17:52,767 --> 03:17:57,375
Maple syrup instead of corn syrup in the in the making of the caramel

1737
03:18:00,703 --> 03:18:02,239
Did you guys hear Adam when he said that

1738
03:18:04,031 --> 03:18:06,335
I know I smoked maple but I wasn't sure

1739
03:18:06,591 --> 03:18:08,127
About the maple syrup

1740
03:18:09,919 --> 03:18:11,199
Maple smoked bacon

1741
03:18:11,455 --> 03:18:12,991
Difference

1742
03:18:15,295 --> 03:18:16,063
Nothing

1743
03:18:16,319 --> 03:18:17,343
Does Sarah smell

1744
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:19,647
Every Power

1745
03:18:19,903 --> 03:18:24,511
That apparently used maple syrup instead of corn syrup on this batch

1746
03:18:24,767 --> 03:18:25,535
Make the caramel

1747
03:18:30,399 --> 03:18:35,775
A variation of disrespect separated into and that has a very interesting kid I like that a lot

1748
03:18:40,127 --> 03:18:42,175
I'm going to try to do caramel apple

1749
03:18:42,431 --> 03:18:43,967
Raffle business

1750
03:18:45,247 --> 03:18:46,271
Skills

1751
03:18:47,551 --> 03:18:50,367
We have some people coming out of the woodwork because

1752
03:18:51,391 --> 03:18:54,719
Making popcorn with medicine

1753
03:18:55,231 --> 03:18:57,791
Subway something that makes sense to everyone was brought up

1754
03:19:02,143 --> 03:19:05,471
I'm thinking I'm not getting any kind of configuration from device zero

1755
03:19:08,287 --> 03:19:13,151
I guess for the time being we can just use the configuration data that was provided binaril

1756
03:19:13,407 --> 03:19:17,759
I wish they were all stuck around I'm sure he'd be extremely helpful right now

1757
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:33,119
So the other thing I wanted to touch on was we do need a better disambiguation

1758
03:19:35,167 --> 03:19:41,311
Wait when do you think you'll have the other live streams up on your Channel.

1759
03:19:41,567 --> 03:19:45,151
I want this one's going to become live by tomorrow morning

1760
03:19:52,319 --> 03:19:56,927
I'm not exactly sure I know device year was the one that I send the magic codes to

1761
03:19:57,695 --> 03:20:02,815
But it's sending me this thing here which to me looks a lot like those magic codes that I had been sending to it

1762
03:20:03,327 --> 03:20:06,143
Godlike turn on codes

1763
03:20:06,655 --> 03:20:07,167
So

1764
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:09,215
I'm not really sure what's up with that

1765
03:20:10,495 --> 03:20:13,055
The magic is that in here no that's in USB

1766
03:20:13,311 --> 03:20:13,823
Magic

1767
03:20:14,847 --> 03:20:15,359
Yeah

1768
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:29,439
702 Wanda today ad so it's 78 now it's 87-78

1769
03:20:32,255 --> 03:20:37,119
Access interesting does anybody know if 8729 or valid gzip headers

1770
03:20:39,423 --> 03:20:42,239
Actually I'm streets I just read it all in one Fell Swoop

1771
03:20:45,055 --> 03:20:47,103
Doesn't look like she's a data

1772
03:20:49,151 --> 03:20:50,943
Apparently they're saying the archives

1773
03:20:51,199 --> 03:20:52,735
Previous dreams was not

1774
03:20:54,015 --> 03:20:55,807
Darken my previous dreams are definitely Bello

1775
03:20:57,599 --> 03:21:01,695
Oh wait hey internal trivia or Infinity trivia

1776
03:21:01,951 --> 03:21:08,095
If you can please try to get some of the packet dumps of somebody pulling the configuration data from the

1777
03:21:08,351 --> 03:21:09,887
From The Watchmen controller

1778
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:22,175
Is this part for your part 4

1779
03:21:24,479 --> 03:21:24,991
This is

1780
03:21:25,247 --> 03:21:26,271
Kind of part 4

1781
03:21:26,783 --> 03:21:28,063
There is no part 3

1782
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:28,831
Okay

1783
03:21:29,087 --> 03:21:31,647
Part one was like actually to live streams

1784
03:21:32,159 --> 03:21:33,695
This is part of part 2

1785
03:21:33,951 --> 03:21:37,791
Kampar to is where we try to find the location of the lighthouses

1786
03:21:39,327 --> 03:21:40,351
I can see

1787
03:21:40,863 --> 03:21:43,679
The two videos a week ago and 5 days ago

1788
03:21:48,287 --> 03:21:50,591
Yeah I'm thinking it's probably not Jesus as well

1789
03:21:51,103 --> 03:21:54,175
But it doesn't actually look as much like the

1790
03:21:54,943 --> 03:21:56,479
The default data are the

1791
03:21:57,247 --> 03:21:59,295
What herb is the setting date of I thought it would

1792
03:22:17,471 --> 03:22:18,751
No it's part 2 episode 2

1793
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:29,503
Yeah that does not seem to be I'm really curious now

1794
03:22:49,727 --> 03:22:54,335
I wonder if it's possible to get more data at once from the head reports

1795
03:23:03,551 --> 03:23:04,575
Tunis

1796
03:23:04,831 --> 03:23:05,855
3315

1797
03:23:11,231 --> 03:23:13,279
Marco pasta crumstown spider in Firefox

1798
03:23:14,559 --> 03:23:20,447
Itsfunneh sometimes boxel tactical run better in Chrome sometimes better than Firefox I've never figured out why

1799
03:23:20,959 --> 03:23:22,751
Jimmy is asking if there's a knot

1800
03:23:24,799 --> 03:23:28,127
No there is no non browser version of axel toxic

1801
03:23:28,383 --> 03:23:32,479
Voxel tastic is based off of the render engine from no Euclid

1802
03:23:32,991 --> 03:23:36,831
Which is not a browser thing it said it's only on regular computer

1803
03:23:37,087 --> 03:23:38,367
Tom

1804
03:23:38,623 --> 03:23:44,767
If you guys haven't seen no Euclid it's totally worth looking up I think cuz I think it's pretty cool but I made it so I'm

1805
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:47,583
Really biased on that

1806
03:23:48,095 --> 03:23:53,727
I think a lot of things are really cool even I don't make them but you know what I do make them I wouldn't do it if I didn't think it was cool

1807
03:24:02,943 --> 03:24:05,759
So I guess I could have a larger control message

1808
03:24:22,911 --> 03:24:26,751
Yeah I know I'm going to cut it off in about 4 hours and stare over

1809
03:24:27,519 --> 03:24:28,031
Jaquez

1810
03:24:28,543 --> 03:24:31,359
We didn't actually start recording until about maybe 10 minutes in

1811
03:24:46,719 --> 03:24:49,023
Make the buffer bigger and see what happens if I just read it

1812
03:25:00,287 --> 03:25:03,103
The control message sent back 128 B

1813
03:25:05,663 --> 03:25:06,687
That's interesting

1814
03:25:10,015 --> 03:25:12,831
54 cuz I thought that was the biggest you're allowed to make them

1815
03:25:58,143 --> 03:26:02,495
I'll print out the character day. Let me just try making sure there's nothing good at the end of this

1816
03:26:03,775 --> 03:26:04,543
Oh that's weird

1817
03:26:04,799 --> 03:26:06,079
I-Ready togetherness

1818
03:26:07,871 --> 03:26:08,383
Yeah

1819
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:14,527
So apparently you're not allowed to make it bigger than 128 otherwise it just gets host

1820
03:26:17,343 --> 03:26:18,623
Freak out

1821
03:26:36,799 --> 03:26:38,847
I know none of this looks like character data

1822
03:26:52,927 --> 03:26:55,999
Yeah it says the same thing the first time and the second so

1823
03:26:57,535 --> 03:26:59,839
Yeah I don't think this is configuration data

1824
03:27:01,119 --> 03:27:07,263
If anybody wouldn't mind getting some pcap dumps of reading the stator from a actual

1825
03:27:07,519 --> 03:27:13,663
Vive on a Windows box that would be pretty cool try and understand what what message I would have to send

1826
03:27:13,919 --> 03:27:17,247
You just take the pcap and then send me a copy to be cap

1827
03:27:17,759 --> 03:27:20,575
That way we can see how they actually pull the data off

1828
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:29,279
You know I have a 5 setup for their break

1829
03:27:30,559 --> 03:27:31,071
What

1830
03:27:31,839 --> 03:27:32,351
You can just ask

1831
03:27:34,655 --> 03:27:36,191
Weaning I have a virus

1832
03:27:36,959 --> 03:27:37,471
UMBC

1833
03:27:37,727 --> 03:27:39,007
Have a seal do that later

1834
03:27:44,895 --> 03:27:46,687
Switch Amazon

1835
03:27:47,455 --> 03:27:47,967
Call

1836
03:27:48,223 --> 03:27:50,015
Most with little endian

1837
03:27:51,295 --> 03:27:53,343
Bananas looks like actual data so

1838
03:27:56,671 --> 03:28:02,815
I mean fffffffffff that looks like a like this might have like Max in it or something

1839
03:28:03,071 --> 03:28:07,423
Mac Mac addresses or something better

1840
03:28:07,679 --> 03:28:09,215
Infinite rival said they posted

1841
03:28:09,727 --> 03:28:10,239
Play

1842
03:28:11,263 --> 03:28:12,799
Oh and finish 3000 is

1843
03:28:15,871 --> 03:28:18,687
Well somebody said my Rollin them at all

1844
03:28:19,967 --> 03:28:22,271
Hell yeah oh cool hey thanks Tyrell

1845
03:28:22,527 --> 03:28:26,367
You're up to start piping up and chat so we know that you're all you're working on things

1846
03:28:27,135 --> 03:28:28,415
I think he has but

1847
03:28:29,183 --> 03:28:29,695
No

1848
03:28:30,975 --> 03:28:36,351
StudyLink couldn't wait a minute Herp Derp infinite trivial is nairo

1849
03:28:37,119 --> 03:28:41,983
Yes we just went through that okay I did not catch that until right now

1850
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:48,383
Oh wait you LinkedIn chat did you also posted in the the issue cuz I can see the issues I can't see chat on my mile

1851
03:28:48,639 --> 03:28:49,151
A laptop

1852
03:28:55,039 --> 03:28:55,807
Sort through

1853
03:28:56,063 --> 03:28:56,575
Help

1854
03:28:56,831 --> 03:29:02,975
I'm pretty quick with Wireshark I'd love to be able to do that right now if you have the pcaps I can do that right now on air

1855
03:29:10,399 --> 03:29:15,007
Norah infinite trivial where Where is the

1856
03:29:15,263 --> 03:29:21,407
He disappointed don't Lincoln chat I can't read it if it's in Chatta can only read it if it's in the

1857
03:29:21,663 --> 03:29:23,199
The issue in in GitHub

1858
03:29:23,711 --> 03:29:28,575
Sorry I didn't mean to get angry

1859
03:29:40,863 --> 03:29:42,655
Nitro can you off

1860
03:29:44,447 --> 03:29:49,567
I'm sorry I didn't mean to get angry everything you're doing is so helpful thank you so much

1861
03:29:55,199 --> 03:29:57,759
Yay thank you

1862
03:30:09,791 --> 03:30:14,655
Which one which number do you think would be the most likely to contain

1863
03:30:16,191 --> 03:30:19,263
This one may be turning the wireless controllers on

1864
03:30:21,823 --> 03:30:23,615
First to do you think that's where it would be

1865
03:30:25,919 --> 03:30:32,063
What which recipe or I'm specifically after the messages that would pull the configuration data from the

1866
03:30:33,599 --> 03:30:39,743
From The Watchmen controllers so probably am guess

1867
03:30:41,023 --> 03:30:45,375
But if it lives on the the controllers and how would that be possible

1868
03:30:46,911 --> 03:30:51,519
Poet lived the actual controller from selves controllers

1869
03:30:59,711 --> 03:31:01,759
Delhi Metro they do take a little bit once

1870
03:31:02,015 --> 03:31:03,551
Turn on Netflix

1871
03:31:04,063 --> 03:31:05,343
And use USB.

1872
03:31:05,599 --> 03:31:06,111
Addressee

1873
03:31:06,367 --> 03:31:08,671
What contains 1.11

1874
03:31:15,071 --> 03:31:16,095
1.1.1

1875
03:31:16,351 --> 03:31:17,375
1.11

1876
03:31:18,143 --> 03:31:19,167
Oh really

1877
03:31:20,959 --> 03:31:21,983
No nothing

1878
03:31:23,775 --> 03:31:25,311
Not 1.1.1 either

1879
03:31:31,711 --> 03:31:33,247
Process not using a mouse

1880
03:31:37,087 --> 03:31:39,135
We spent 15 minutes fixing the mouth

1881
03:31:39,903 --> 03:31:43,487
At the beginning of the Stream

1882
03:31:44,511 --> 03:31:48,351
I don't believe an actual mice

1883
03:31:48,863 --> 03:31:55,007
I mean I use them sometimes but only you know whenever I believe touchpads are a completely cromulent

1884
03:31:55,263 --> 03:31:59,103
Mechanism for a kid getting human input into computer

1885
03:32:01,151 --> 03:32:02,687
Get out

1886
03:32:07,295 --> 03:32:09,343
Not really I thought I was going to tell your first flight

1887
03:32:09,599 --> 03:32:11,135
Absolutely love having a surface

1888
03:32:12,671 --> 03:32:13,183
Iwawa

1889
03:32:13,695 --> 03:32:17,279
Okay here's a bunch of USB controller

1890
03:32:17,535 --> 03:32:18,559
Does a Surface Pro

1891
03:32:20,863 --> 03:32:23,167
Fac3

1892
03:32:23,423 --> 03:32:27,263
What alphabets say configuration

1893
03:32:33,151 --> 03:32:33,919
See here

1894
03:32:34,431 --> 03:32:35,455
Interesting art

1895
03:32:47,999 --> 03:32:53,119
Oh that's interesting it so it looks like what's going on is it sending something that tells it

1896
03:32:53,375 --> 03:32:59,007
Dear watchdog or watch Watchmen please send me your configuration and then it keeps pulling it

1897
03:33:00,799 --> 03:33:04,127
I think that's what's going on listen to a different device altogether

1898
03:33:06,431 --> 03:33:11,295
Ice picture 1900s

1899
03:33:14,879 --> 03:33:17,695
But I don't see anything being returned

1900
03:33:18,463 --> 03:33:18,975
I mean

1901
03:33:23,839 --> 03:33:27,167
Wow hello data

1902
03:33:36,383 --> 03:33:38,431
78 9C

1903
03:33:38,687 --> 03:33:41,247
Now that looks like some magic

1904
03:33:42,015 --> 03:33:48,159
That looks exactly like the kind of magic I'm after at least 79

1905
03:33:48,415 --> 03:33:51,487
She is a valid Jesus thing

1906
03:34:10,943 --> 03:34:13,759
It's not Jesus what is the

1907
03:34:17,343 --> 03:34:21,183
Online gzip calculator I guess I would say

1908
03:34:22,207 --> 03:34:23,999
190 + 111 / 2

1909
03:34:30,655 --> 03:34:31,679
Deflate

1910
03:34:32,191 --> 03:34:32,959
Haha

1911
03:34:46,527 --> 03:34:52,671
7890

1912
03:34:52,927 --> 03:34:57,023
I guess I was a little loud sorry about that

1913
03:34:57,279 --> 03:34:57,791
Surprises

1914
03:34:59,839 --> 03:35:04,703
But something happened in order to get that what did they do to request it

1915
03:35:23,391 --> 03:35:24,671
Two starts there

1916
03:35:25,439 --> 03:35:27,999
So what did they say 1.1 1.0 was

1917
03:35:31,071 --> 03:35:31,583
Brandon

1918
03:35:32,095 --> 03:35:34,655
190 and 1 11:00 or the 12

1919
03:35:39,007 --> 03:35:40,287
Not wrong

1920
03:35:41,311 --> 03:35:45,407
When you say the wireless controller so like the package is going to the controller here

1921
03:35:45,663 --> 03:35:51,807
Is that like the actual same device that I would be talking to when I'm beat like getting the light data to and from the device

1922
03:36:04,863 --> 03:36:11,007
Oh yeah I know I know I'm going to do that in a minute but I just wanted to make sure I'm actually looking at the right thing and that I can actually talk to this I don't have to

1923
03:36:11,263 --> 03:36:12,543
Do something wacky to get a tub

1924
03:36:13,567 --> 03:36:17,151
Start talking to some other way

1925
03:36:29,695 --> 03:36:30,975
I guess

1926
03:36:31,999 --> 03:36:33,535
That's awesome thank you Night Raw

1927
03:36:35,071 --> 03:36:38,911
I do not know enough about usb particles to not be totally confused by this

1928
03:36:40,191 --> 03:36:46,335
Hey so online sees I ca-78 9C in this USB

1929
03:36:46,591 --> 03:36:47,359
Control packet

1930
03:36:47,615 --> 03:36:53,759
And what happens if you speaking for packets is it's a really simple command you sending control packet and it sends you dated back

1931
03:36:54,271 --> 03:37:00,415
But I specifically I've been looking for something it has 789c in the s b

1932
03:37:00,671 --> 03:37:03,743
Because I know that valve compresses whiskey zip

1933
03:37:03,999 --> 03:37:04,767
The

1934
03:37:05,279 --> 03:37:09,631
They take the config data compress it down and then put that on the

1935
03:37:10,143 --> 03:37:14,495
On the controller or on the device and that's the compressed configuration data

1936
03:37:15,007 --> 03:37:18,591
So because I see this 78 9C

1937
03:37:18,847 --> 03:37:21,919
I know that somewhere around here they're sending us some magic

1938
03:37:22,175 --> 03:37:25,503
Dust that makes it go and give me the data

1939
03:37:26,015 --> 03:37:28,831
Heck did you figure out that 78 9C

1940
03:37:29,343 --> 03:37:30,623
Was there compressed data

1941
03:37:30,879 --> 03:37:37,023
Oh okay so the way I do that so frenchton saw what I just did here was I took data I just said test

1942
03:37:38,303 --> 03:37:41,631
And I compressor using the deflate algorithm

1943
03:37:41,887 --> 03:37:45,215
And so this thing just returns it in in base64

1944
03:37:45,471 --> 03:37:51,615
If it base64 eyes it and dump it through hexdump it starts with 78 9C which is the magic that says

1945
03:37:52,639 --> 03:37:55,455
Deflate compressed file and

1946
03:37:55,711 --> 03:38:01,343
Something about the weights decompressed and that's what the 9C is but I don't really know what that magic is

1947
03:38:01,599 --> 03:38:04,671
That is to Latitude you I've never seen before and I like it

1948
03:38:07,743 --> 03:38:08,511
Tom

1949
03:38:11,583 --> 03:38:12,351
So

1950
03:38:12,863 --> 03:38:16,447
I think I've learned Warren list three hours they have this entire semester

1951
03:38:19,007 --> 03:38:22,335
That's depressing

1952
03:38:26,175 --> 03:38:29,759
Okay so the conversation with one 11-0 starts here

1953
03:38:30,271 --> 03:38:32,063
Control in

1954
03:38:33,343 --> 03:38:34,367
3 minute warning

1955
03:38:34,623 --> 03:38:39,743
No no it's not really three minutes to soft for hours but we did start 15 minutes in

1956
03:38:41,023 --> 03:38:46,143
Let's make it our mission to try to get this the state off this device here in the last few minutes though

1957
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:47,423
Thought so

1958
03:38:51,775 --> 03:38:54,591
Conversation with one 1100 adhere

1959
03:38:54,847 --> 03:38:56,639
Animal Control message in

1960
03:38:59,199 --> 03:39:02,527
Whatever it's just getting some data I don't really care what it does

1961
03:39:10,719 --> 03:39:12,511
Control out

1962
03:39:13,535 --> 03:39:14,559
Herb setup

1963
03:39:16,607 --> 03:39:20,703
Okay so it's saying request length 64

1964
03:39:23,263 --> 03:39:25,055
Tri-Valley 3ff

1965
03:39:26,847 --> 03:39:28,639
I don't know what that is

1966
03:39:29,919 --> 03:39:32,223
Maybe there's another way of getting the

1967
03:39:32,479 --> 03:39:34,271
The data from the device that I'm unaware of

1968
03:40:00,383 --> 03:40:05,759
Ff8 300 V6 that looks like trash to me

1969
03:40:09,343 --> 03:40:12,159
It's not trash that's us sending the Watchmen

1970
03:40:12,671 --> 03:40:16,255
Is that some sort of magic code that gets sent to the Watchmen

1971
03:40:16,511 --> 03:40:21,375
Yeah I don't know what it is I don't care but I guess that means I should probably be sending it

1972
03:40:23,423 --> 03:40:26,239
But it then it looks like if I start issuing

1973
03:40:31,615 --> 03:40:33,151
This message here

1974
03:40:34,687 --> 03:40:36,223
The request for in

1975
03:40:39,039 --> 03:40:42,879
And I just keep requesting it eventually The Watchmen response

1976
03:40:44,159 --> 03:40:46,719
Much much

1977
03:40:47,231 --> 03:40:48,511
Actually responds with

1978
03:40:48,767 --> 03:40:50,303
The actual compression

1979
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:51,071
Stop

1980
03:40:55,423 --> 03:40:56,191
Scroll down too far

1981
03:40:58,495 --> 03:41:00,543
Well that's weird it sends this data first

1982
03:41:05,663 --> 03:41:07,199
Oh weird

1983
03:41:08,223 --> 03:41:09,503
Okay wait so

1984
03:41:09,759 --> 03:41:11,551
310

1985
03:41:13,855 --> 03:41:16,159
What is the actual control message look like

1986
03:41:18,975 --> 03:41:19,999
In

1987
03:41:25,887 --> 03:41:27,679
It's right here get feature report

1988
03:41:28,191 --> 03:41:31,263
I miss you in a lie to USB control transfer

1989
03:41:32,799 --> 03:41:38,431
With the transfer into means I'm requesting data from the devices is how I get the config from the the main

1990
03:41:38,943 --> 03:41:40,479
The main thing

1991
03:41:40,991 --> 03:41:44,319
And it's using 0 x 300

1992
03:41:45,855 --> 03:41:46,623
Or

1993
03:41:47,391 --> 03:41:48,159
Data

1994
03:41:48,671 --> 03:41:49,951
Waterdata 0

1995
03:41:51,743 --> 03:41:53,023
Test request one

1996
03:41:54,047 --> 03:41:55,071
310

1997
03:41:56,351 --> 03:41:58,399
W index of 0

1998
03:42:00,191 --> 03:42:01,727
I guess that's the interface number

1999
03:42:06,847 --> 03:42:10,431
See you sad that it's past here so it's interface interface

2000
03:42:12,735 --> 03:42:14,271
Device interface

2001
03:42:21,183 --> 03:42:22,975
But they 20 has to be cat

2002
03:42:28,607 --> 03:42:29,631
What's the weather for this one

2003
03:42:31,679 --> 03:42:32,703
11

2004
03:42:33,727 --> 03:42:35,007
Okay what about this one

2005
03:42:37,311 --> 03:42:37,823
11

2006
03:42:38,079 --> 03:42:39,359
Okay so I can supply

2007
03:42:40,127 --> 03:42:41,663
Hand starts at all

2008
03:42:43,455 --> 03:42:46,271
If I read 11 whole bunch so they're AAA

2009
03:42:47,295 --> 03:42:48,319
10

2010
03:42:54,207 --> 03:42:56,255
So that should be responding

2011
03:43:00,863 --> 03:43:04,959
Maybe I have to issue this several times to get a response

2012
03:43:10,079 --> 03:43:13,919
Okay watch 1000 that's right tags 0

2013
03:43:14,687 --> 03:43:15,711
H20

2014
03:43:16,991 --> 03:43:19,039
Let's try running it again and see what I say

2015
03:43:33,887 --> 03:43:36,703
Know what am I doing wrong why is that not

2016
03:43:47,967 --> 03:43:48,735
AOC

2017
03:44:29,695 --> 03:44:34,047
Maybe I have to issue the other command first before it'll start talking in any reasonable sense

2018
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:42,751
So I am I'm sending a request one

2019
03:44:43,007 --> 03:44:44,543
W value 310

2020
03:44:45,055 --> 03:44:47,359
Andw index 0000

2021
03:44:48,127 --> 03:44:50,431
But I am getting data back why am I getting data back

2022
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:08,863
No I got to turn that down from 128

2023
03:45:17,055 --> 03:45:18,591
64

2024
03:45:19,359 --> 03:45:23,199
This 64x back why is what I'm getting from the watchdog

2025
03:45:23,967 --> 03:45:25,247
Oh

2026
03:46:00,831 --> 03:46:04,671
Getting negative power Norfolk Power them on

2027
03:46:07,231 --> 03:46:08,255
Hey Nara

2028
03:46:08,511 --> 03:46:09,791
You think that it saw

2029
03:46:10,303 --> 03:46:12,863
I guess you think that they are stored in the

2030
03:46:13,887 --> 03:46:16,191
They're sort of the Watchman right now than the other thing

2031
03:46:16,703 --> 03:46:18,239
Charles is doing

2032
03:46:18,495 --> 03:46:22,335
Noticed what

2033
03:46:22,591 --> 03:46:24,383
Top of the Chattanooga

2034
03:46:26,431 --> 03:46:30,015
You were asked if you for guy or seek me answered that

2035
03:46:32,575 --> 03:46:35,391
What does Charles know about usb album

2036
03:46:35,647 --> 03:46:41,791
Charles is doing Charles on his code and he won't respond to anything we don't Shout at the back of his head

2037
03:46:42,047 --> 03:46:42,559
Yes correct

2038
03:46:45,119 --> 03:46:47,679
Easily 5 minutes

2039
03:46:54,847 --> 03:46:57,407
What I was going to say is who watches the Watchmen

2040
03:47:03,039 --> 03:47:06,879
Install USB mod on my computer and see what the messages going out at

2041
03:47:52,191 --> 03:47:53,983
So I'm sending you control transfer

2042
03:47:55,519 --> 03:47:58,591
Ameriquest type is a one request one

2043
03:47:59,359 --> 03:48:00,895
W value 310

2044
03:48:01,663 --> 03:48:02,687
000

2045
03:48:07,295 --> 03:48:08,575
Devices responding with

2046
03:48:12,159 --> 03:48:12,671
Nothing

2047
03:48:14,207 --> 03:48:15,231
Nothing at all

2048
03:48:16,511 --> 03:48:19,327
So what makes it so different when they ask for it

2049
03:48:22,911 --> 03:48:23,935
You actually know what you're doing

2050
03:48:24,703 --> 03:48:25,471
So here

2051
03:48:27,519 --> 03:48:31,615
The steam stuff is connecting and it's issuing this command

2052
03:48:31,871 --> 03:48:38,015
Maybe we need to send the Watchman a command in order to get the Watchman to start responding

2053
03:48:42,367 --> 03:48:44,159
Okay

2054
03:48:48,767 --> 03:48:50,047
Float config

2055
03:48:54,143 --> 03:48:57,215
How make another parameter that has an extra magic flag

2056
03:48:57,471 --> 03:48:59,263
I don't think I already learned

2057
03:49:00,031 --> 03:49:00,799
Yeah I don't either

2058
03:49:15,903 --> 03:49:18,463
Where the controllers officially called Watchmen

2059
03:49:19,487 --> 03:49:20,255
I don't know

2060
03:49:20,511 --> 03:49:24,607
Sister reference that's the reference I've seen everywhere

2061
03:49:25,887 --> 03:49:28,191
Just a lot of people refer to them as Watchmen

2062
03:49:29,471 --> 03:49:32,031
I didn't like houses are called lighthouses but

2063
03:49:32,543 --> 03:49:35,103
Let's just in the official documentation what they call him

2064
03:49:44,831 --> 03:49:46,623
So now and here

2065
03:50:16,063 --> 03:50:22,207
Send extra magic so if it's a Watchman we might need to send these extra messages that are being sent by Steam

2066
03:50:25,535 --> 03:50:26,815
Say start here

2067
03:50:32,191 --> 03:50:34,239
The first one starts with

2068
03:50:35,007 --> 03:50:36,031
Request one

2069
03:50:36,287 --> 03:50:38,847
301w index 0

2070
03:50:39,871 --> 03:50:41,663
01

2071
03:50:45,503 --> 03:50:50,623
Watch for the surname of any lighthouse receiver including the hmd and the controller

2072
03:50:51,647 --> 03:50:54,207
Then why in the world do they specifically called the other is Watchmen

2073
03:50:57,023 --> 03:51:02,143
It's probably a lot more going on than hmd controllers the elections play delinquent

2074
03:51:04,447 --> 03:51:05,471
Capelets run this

2075
03:51:07,263 --> 03:51:11,103
Brett from first 64 that looks interesting let's look at the data

2076
03:51:14,943 --> 03:51:15,967
Anita

2077
03:51:16,223 --> 03:51:17,503
Coffer something

2078
03:51:19,039 --> 03:51:19,807
Terrible allergies

2079
03:51:21,343 --> 03:51:22,367
Sorry okay

2080
03:51:25,439 --> 03:51:27,743
How to get rid of the stupid for Scentsy thing

2081
03:51:35,679 --> 03:51:40,799
So the first ones tagged Euro 1030 to

2082
03:51:43,871 --> 03:51:45,919
That looks like some interesting data

2083
03:51:54,623 --> 03:52:00,255
And that's definitely different data than I do know that's right that's good that's really good that's that's perfect

2084
03:52:00,767 --> 03:52:05,631
Guess what it's still coming back from the valve 01 03 02

2085
03:52:06,655 --> 03:52:11,519
So that means I have successfully finally was able to talk to one of the Watchmen and say something

2086
03:52:12,543 --> 03:52:15,359
I think we make sure that I'm talking to the right device

2087
03:52:18,175 --> 03:52:20,223
Yep I'm talking to device number 2

2088
03:52:20,479 --> 03:52:22,271
So I can talk to the Watchman a little bit

2089
03:52:27,647 --> 03:52:30,463
Okay let's see what the next thing that has to get done is

2090
03:52:32,511 --> 03:52:33,535
So after that

2091
03:52:34,559 --> 03:52:35,071
Send

2092
03:52:35,839 --> 03:52:37,119
Albertsons a

2093
03:52:37,631 --> 03:52:39,167
Message out

2094
03:52:43,263 --> 03:52:45,567
Quest 93 FF

2095
03:52:46,591 --> 03:52:49,151
Riverside puts it into some sort of like read mode

2096
03:53:09,375 --> 03:53:11,935
I'll just try skipping messed up cuz that makes me nervous

2097
03:53:12,703 --> 03:53:14,495
The next one is a control in

2098
03:53:15,775 --> 03:53:17,055
That makes me less nervous

2099
03:53:17,311 --> 03:53:23,455
By the way the reason why are the way I blew away the configuration that's that was my son to control out when I should have sent a control in so just

2100
03:53:23,711 --> 03:53:25,247
Deleted the whole configuration file

2101
03:53:26,271 --> 03:53:27,039
Second-guessing

2102
03:53:27,295 --> 03:53:31,647
Yeah I'm going to avoid those messages

2103
03:53:31,903 --> 03:53:33,439
His best yeah yeah

2104
03:53:38,303 --> 03:53:41,375
What's just try this once without sending the control message I'll see if it

2105
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:43,167
Takis Takis

2106
03:53:44,447 --> 03:53:46,751
Can't you just go to reset

2107
03:53:47,007 --> 03:53:48,543
No

2108
03:53:49,311 --> 03:53:51,103
You can't

2109
03:53:55,455 --> 03:53:57,247
Discovered this the hard way

2110
03:53:59,551 --> 03:54:00,831
So it returns

2111
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:03,647
FF

2112
03:54:04,159 --> 03:54:04,927
Oh

2113
03:54:05,439 --> 03:54:06,463
Bombs

2114
03:54:08,255 --> 03:54:12,095
So is their thing when they run it return something meaningful

2115
03:54:12,607 --> 03:54:15,423
When I run it returns just a bunch of zeros

2116
03:54:54,079 --> 03:54:56,895
Yes it returns a bunch of zeros for me

2117
03:54:58,431 --> 03:55:02,527
I might need to send a control message that makes me so stupid nervous

2118
03:55:25,567 --> 03:55:29,151
Is anybody else has got more familiar with

2119
03:55:29,663 --> 03:55:34,271
More familiar with the way the hidden requests work that they'll be able to look at this packet and tell me

2120
03:55:35,807 --> 03:55:39,391
What it really is doing so I don't have to worry about damaging my Watchmen

2121
03:55:57,567 --> 03:56:00,639
Also I want to see real quick if they send something else to say

2122
03:56:02,431 --> 03:56:03,455
Replay mode

2123
03:56:03,711 --> 03:56:04,479
May don't

2124
03:56:10,879 --> 03:56:11,647
Baby here

2125
03:56:24,703 --> 03:56:27,263
That makes me so nervous I don't want to do it

2126
03:56:29,823 --> 03:56:31,359
The magic what are some that look like

2127
03:56:52,607 --> 03:56:54,143
Doesn't quite look like that either

2128
03:57:00,799 --> 03:57:02,079
Okay

2129
03:57:02,335 --> 03:57:06,175
Play white guys I'm going to go turn this off now

2130
03:57:06,431 --> 03:57:12,063
And what Imma do is going to get Adam to backup the configuration on these Watchmen so we don't accidentally blow it away

2131
03:57:12,575 --> 03:57:18,719
And then what I'm going to do is just use exactly the same messages that values in order to know send

2132
03:57:18,975 --> 03:57:20,767
Nothing to watch Venom pull it back off

2133
03:57:21,023 --> 03:57:25,375
And I guess you'll just have to see the summary video that'll be coming out sometime later this week wait

2134
03:57:30,239 --> 03:57:31,007
In the next few days

2135
03:57:31,263 --> 03:57:32,543
Stalin

2136
03:57:33,055 --> 03:57:36,383
You'll be quite noticeable if you know what to look for

2137
03:57:37,151 --> 03:57:37,663
Allen

2138
03:57:38,175 --> 03:57:42,271
I can see in these these Wireshark dumps you're sending a control message out

2139
03:57:42,527 --> 03:57:44,831
And then when you send this other control message n

2140
03:57:46,111 --> 03:57:51,743
The valve thing totally or sorry about the valve thing the watch man totally gives us gives you data back

2141
03:57:52,255 --> 03:57:54,047
When I run it however

2142
03:57:54,559 --> 03:58:00,703
The Watchmen does not give me data back instead of f whatever it sends FF you said you get f

2143
03:58:00,959 --> 03:58:01,727
83

2144
03:58:01,983 --> 03:58:03,263
I got FF

2145
03:58:04,031 --> 03:58:05,055
100

2146
03:58:05,311 --> 03:58:06,335
Male actually

2147
03:58:07,359 --> 03:58:13,503
If you think you might be able just get me though the configs for these I don't have to go over and back

2148
03:58:13,759 --> 03:58:14,271
Back him up

2149
03:58:15,039 --> 03:58:17,343
If you want to just get the shot right now

2150
03:58:17,855 --> 03:58:19,647
I'm just so nervous to

2151
03:58:19,903 --> 03:58:21,183
Accidentally blow it away

2152
03:58:23,999 --> 03:58:25,023
Oh

2153
03:58:25,535 --> 03:58:31,679
Alan what I'm trying to do is get the configuration off the Watchmen by treat the Watchmen

2154
03:58:31,935 --> 03:58:32,959
Like the

2155
03:58:33,471 --> 03:58:39,359
If I treat the Watchman like a bhmd it just doesn't send anything at all from the

2156
03:58:39,615 --> 03:58:41,151
From the configuration data

2157
03:58:41,407 --> 03:58:42,431
It just nothing

2158
03:58:42,687 --> 03:58:45,247
On what it's looking like is that

2159
03:58:45,759 --> 03:58:47,807
And the actual thing that you're doing

2160
03:58:48,063 --> 03:58:50,623
You're you're sending the

2161
03:58:52,159 --> 03:58:58,303
So you're doing the same sort of thing so like I in order to get the config like I will send a 305

2162
03:58:58,559 --> 03:58:59,327
Start a chat

2163
03:59:01,631 --> 03:59:03,679
But

2164
03:59:05,215 --> 03:59:10,591
No I know I can use Lighthouse console to get the configs but I don't I have to go over to Adam's room

2165
03:59:11,103 --> 03:59:17,247
Do all that stuff to back everything up before I can start pulling the config here in this code I have to be able to make this code pulled

2166
03:59:17,503 --> 03:59:18,783
The config the self

2167
03:59:34,911 --> 03:59:35,423
So

2168
03:59:37,471 --> 03:59:38,751
Okay

2169
03:59:40,799 --> 03:59:44,383
Yeah okay fine fine Allen I'll go do that

2170
03:59:45,919 --> 03:59:47,711
Actually Adam

2171
03:59:48,223 --> 03:59:51,039
If I plug the Vive in out here

2172
03:59:51,295 --> 03:59:56,415
Can you ask you to command at the the lighthouse Consul I'll email to you

2173
03:59:58,207 --> 04:00:01,279
Emails a bit of a pain with the way I have it all set up

2174
04:00:03,583 --> 04:00:07,167
Can one of you guys email him the link is in issue number five

2175
04:00:12,543 --> 04:00:16,127
Go to issue number 5 on live survive and pull out the

2176
04:00:21,503 --> 04:00:27,647
Adam can you open up just get hub.com seeing lures

2177
04:00:27,903 --> 04:00:28,927
Flashlight survive

2178
04:00:31,487 --> 04:00:35,071
Okay I guess we'll go do all this right now

2179
04:00:36,095 --> 04:00:39,935
No I've learned that's why we're going to be backing up the configuration

2180
04:00:40,959 --> 04:00:43,007
Methuen plug everything in

2181
04:00:44,287 --> 04:00:46,079
Be boring

2182
04:00:49,407 --> 04:00:54,527
Say what I think

2183
04:01:02,975 --> 04:01:04,767
Look up issue number five

2184
04:01:05,791 --> 04:01:10,143
And somebody posted a link to the narrow Lighthouse redox thing

2185
04:01:10,399 --> 04:01:12,191
And from there you can

2186
04:01:12,447 --> 04:01:18,591
I get all that Oso internet you might think this is entertaining I don't have access to computer

2187
04:01:18,847 --> 04:01:24,479
Fast enough but Adam in the room back over there does so we

2188
04:01:25,759 --> 04:01:27,295
We actually

2189
04:01:27,807 --> 04:01:30,111
Cuz I can

2190
04:01:30,367 --> 04:01:31,391
Are you doing

2191
04:01:31,903 --> 04:01:38,047
You can see right there in the very center there is cable coming out of the

2192
04:01:38,303 --> 04:01:43,423
Attic that goes down to Adams computer so that we can actually

2193
04:01:44,447 --> 04:01:46,495
Get the data get the

2194
04:01:46,751 --> 04:01:48,543
USB and everything

2195
04:01:48,799 --> 04:01:50,079
From his room out here

2196
04:01:50,591 --> 04:01:51,871
So I'm going to go

2197
04:01:53,663 --> 04:01:59,807
Was this is the USB extension a player can pull off at config so we don't accidentally blow it all off

2198
04:02:12,095 --> 04:02:13,631
So

2199
04:02:15,935 --> 04:02:21,567
That right there is now going to Adam's room and I'm going to try to get Adam to back up the config file so

2200
04:02:21,823 --> 04:02:23,359
We don't have to

2201
04:02:23,871 --> 04:02:24,639
Totally

2202
04:02:24,895 --> 04:02:27,967
Blow that away again and go through another couple hours misery

2203
04:02:30,783 --> 04:02:32,831
USB extension

2204
04:02:33,855 --> 04:02:36,927
Long-ass active USB extender

2205
04:02:38,463 --> 04:02:41,535
HDMI

2206
04:02:42,815 --> 04:02:43,327
Wow

2207
04:03:07,903 --> 04:03:10,719
Let's audit doesn't list the lighthouses

2208
04:03:11,743 --> 04:03:15,071
In there

2209
04:03:15,839 --> 04:03:19,167
Palm it's a different LHC number it's

2210
04:03:19,935 --> 04:03:21,983
Well I guess it doesn't say on the box does it

2211
04:03:24,031 --> 04:03:27,103
Yeah those serial numbers are different than the serial numbers in the

2212
04:03:55,775 --> 04:03:57,055
Can you

2213
04:04:03,967 --> 04:04:08,319
So I'm going to open up the configuration file

2214
04:04:09,087 --> 04:04:10,623
For my headset

2215
04:04:11,903 --> 04:04:15,743
And find out hopefully in there to list what the lhr numbers are

2216
04:04:41,599 --> 04:04:42,111
Home

2217
04:04:42,623 --> 04:04:43,135
Bummer

2218
04:04:43,903 --> 04:04:47,743
I guess I didn't post the actual file unless get Adam to open the file and look at it

2219
04:04:49,023 --> 04:04:53,119
Hey Adam email

2220
04:05:22,815 --> 04:05:25,887

04:06:17,599 --> 04:06:18,111

Okay. Power ours plugged in video is not plugged in give it a shot

2230
04:07:10,591 --> 04:07:12,383
You know almost anywhere

2231
04:07:34,655 --> 04:07:35,423
What

2232
04:08:44,543 --> 04:08:45,311
I need help

2233
04:08:46,079 --> 04:08:48,383
Okay

2234
04:08:51,455 --> 04:08:56,319
So I can't figure out how to back this up right now let's see

2235
04:08:56,831 --> 04:08:58,623
He's saying that

2236
04:08:59,135 --> 04:09:02,463
Sorry to hear all your all if you're here they'll be really helpful

2237
04:09:05,279 --> 04:09:06,815
.

2238
04:09:16,799 --> 04:09:20,895
Does anyone know how to get the lhr number for the controllers

2239
04:09:21,407 --> 04:09:24,735
Cuz it's just not showing up in the lighthouse console

2240
04:09:27,039 --> 04:09:27,551
Oh

2241
04:09:29,343 --> 04:09:31,135
Looks like cereal

2242
04:09:32,671 --> 04:09:33,439
Hey Adam

2243
04:10:26,687 --> 04:10:32,831
Did not show it when he run Lighthouse serial

2244
04:10:35,135 --> 04:10:38,207
What are you running Lighthouse console serial

2245
04:10:38,463 --> 04:10:41,535
It only shows it for the

2246
04:10:41,791 --> 04:10:44,607
For the hmd not for the

2247
04:10:44,863 --> 04:10:48,191
These guys just like these guys actually being hooked up

2248
04:10:48,703 --> 04:10:51,007
And like green so

2249
04:10:51,263 --> 04:10:53,311
Not sure what's going on there

2250
04:11:00,223 --> 04:11:01,503
The USB descriptors

2251
04:11:03,295 --> 04:11:09,439
Not mean I just I want to use the lighthouse saying from valve to backup the configuration

2252
04:11:09,695 --> 04:11:10,975
And it's already on these guys

2253
04:11:11,487 --> 04:11:12,767
So that nothing

2254
04:11:13,023 --> 04:11:13,535
Goes

2255
04:11:14,303 --> 04:11:17,375
Like Bonkers when I go send it some commands

2256
04:11:17,887 --> 04:11:19,679
I think I need to send it

2257
04:11:20,191 --> 04:11:20,959
2

2258
04:11:21,215 --> 04:11:26,079
Get the configuration stuff I don't want to Nuke it

2259
04:11:26,591 --> 04:11:32,735
Lighthouse console space cereal and it only shows the

2260
04:11:32,991 --> 04:11:36,575
Hmd number or sorry the lhr numbers for the hmd

2261
04:11:37,087 --> 04:11:38,367
And not for the

2262
04:11:38,623 --> 04:11:39,135
The Watch

2263
04:11:39,391 --> 04:11:40,415
Dog watch band

2264
04:11:40,671 --> 04:11:43,743
Which is really confusing cuz it does show up in Steam

2265
04:11:45,279 --> 04:11:46,559
Not sure what's up with that

2266
04:11:51,423 --> 04:11:57,567
What is lsusb going to tell me she's going to tell me the the the descriptor number is not anything I can backup

2267
04:11:57,823 --> 04:11:58,847
The configuration

2268
04:11:59,103 --> 04:12:01,151
On the The Watchmen with

2269
04:12:06,015 --> 04:12:10,623
Oh that's a reasonable point I guess I can plug these straightened Adams computer

2270
04:12:34,175 --> 04:12:38,783
Um yeah does that mean I do need to plug it in to give it to talk

2271
04:12:46,719 --> 04:12:49,023
Disembodied human arm

2272
04:12:55,935 --> 04:12:58,751
I'll never see that until he goes to edit the video

2273
04:14:45,503 --> 04:14:46,783
Asriel's common

2274
04:14:51,391 --> 04:14:51,903
Indeed

2275
04:14:53,951 --> 04:14:54,975
The person that said

2276
04:14:55,487 --> 04:14:58,047
Yes I know

2277
04:15:03,679 --> 04:15:04,959
Invested

2278
04:15:05,215 --> 04:15:05,983
Wow

2279
04:15:10,335 --> 04:15:10,847
Funniest

2280
04:17:19,103 --> 04:17:21,151
Looks like compact falsified rescued

2281
04:17:29,087 --> 04:17:31,135
You want to say goodbye to everyone

2282
04:17:34,463 --> 04:17:36,767
Oh I meant like Dave cuz I'm about to head out

2283
04:17:44,191 --> 04:17:50,335
All right well have fun with the backing up of the update I'm going to

2284
04:17:50,591 --> 04:17:56,735
Well you already had funny

2285
04:17:56,991 --> 04:17:59,807
I think I'm going to head out

2286
04:18:00,319 --> 04:18:01,343
But a lot of fun

2287
04:18:01,855 --> 04:18:07,999
Thank you for coming to hopefully we'll get to the point where we can start using your stuff soon

2288
04:18:08,255 --> 04:18:12,607
Brenton Adam just emailed a copy of the configs can you connect the

2289
04:18:13,119 --> 04:18:16,703
Are you opening Earth put them in the issue number five

2290
04:18:18,751 --> 04:18:21,055
A store pastebin to issue number five

2291
04:18:21,311 --> 04:18:25,663
Or like not Jesus but like

2292
04:18:26,175 --> 04:18:27,967
I don't even remember my password

2293
04:18:29,503 --> 04:18:31,551
And apparently it's a token now

2294
04:18:33,087 --> 04:18:33,599
Something

2295
04:18:37,951 --> 04:18:40,255
Goodbye Dave

2296
04:18:43,839 --> 04:18:44,863
Look at him leaving

2297
04:18:45,631 --> 04:18:47,167
So sad

2298
04:18:48,959 --> 04:18:50,239
Brendan still here though

2299
04:18:55,615 --> 04:18:56,383
Okay

2300
04:18:57,151 --> 04:19:00,223
We got the config backed up so all is well now

2301
04:19:00,991 --> 04:19:05,087
Anyway now I can go Sunday things data

2302
04:19:05,343 --> 04:19:08,415
And I don't have to worry about really terrible things happening

2303
04:19:08,671 --> 04:19:10,463
At least I don't think I do

2304
04:19:13,791 --> 04:19:15,583
Let's get it crackin

2305
04:19:17,119 --> 04:19:20,447
So it looks like they send this message

2306
04:19:21,471 --> 04:19:23,263
Which is W value

2307
04:19:24,031 --> 04:19:25,311
3ff

2308
04:19:26,591 --> 04:19:28,127
See what we normally do

2309
04:19:32,479 --> 04:19:34,015
Update feature report

2310
04:19:36,319 --> 04:19:38,879
Only resends not that

2311
04:19:40,415 --> 04:19:41,183
So

2312
04:19:42,719 --> 04:19:46,815
At least 09 code yes be requesting 93 FF

2313
04:19:47,071 --> 04:19:50,143
So you should be able to use update feature report this function here

2314
04:19:50,399 --> 04:19:51,935
To go send that value

2315
04:20:13,951 --> 04:20:14,719
By Dave

2316
04:20:19,583 --> 04:20:20,863
Control

2317
04:20:47,743 --> 04:20:50,303
Your quest 9W lenk64

2318
04:20:51,839 --> 04:20:57,983
What am I missing

2319
04:20:58,495 --> 04:21:02,335
Cuz we should take a look at the data though that's coming back I don't understand how that works

2320
04:21:06,431 --> 04:21:08,991
Sure whatever I will

2321
04:21:10,527 --> 04:21:15,135
How does that work it says it's going to from host to their from host to their

2322
04:21:15,391 --> 04:21:16,671
Nitro are you still

2323
04:21:17,951 --> 04:21:21,535
Waited anyone get to somewhere on the post Lucia come yet

2324
04:21:23,071 --> 04:21:25,119
I'm back in

2325
04:21:25,631 --> 04:21:28,959
When you get back in chat and see what's happened earlier

2326
04:21:29,471 --> 04:21:30,239
I mean

2327
04:21:30,495 --> 04:21:32,287
VK Tuesday's been saying things

2328
04:21:37,663 --> 04:21:43,807
We were finding the position of the the o.c. I'll show you that part but you missed a little bit

2329
04:21:44,063 --> 04:21:48,671
Earlier was were using this point-cloud to approximate the positions of where it thinks

2330
04:21:48,927 --> 04:21:53,791
Be at the camera Mighty this is pretty terrible the way that this one was configured

2331
04:21:54,047 --> 04:21:59,423
But we do have other other ones that when we ran it produce some pretty good results

2332
04:21:59,935 --> 04:22:04,031
I can show you some of them I think that I still have some of those files around

2333
04:22:04,543 --> 04:22:05,823
Under combiner

2334
04:22:07,103 --> 04:22:08,639
Whoopsies that's wrong

2335
04:22:16,063 --> 04:22:16,575
Say what

2336
04:22:17,343 --> 04:22:18,367
Looking for external

2337
04:22:18,623 --> 04:22:19,391
Yeah that's fine

2338
04:22:23,231 --> 04:22:24,767
Okay so here

2339
04:22:25,279 --> 04:22:31,423
This was also I guess I'm a bad dataset but someone they get pretty good this is the point cloud

2340
04:22:31,679 --> 04:22:33,215
Oldies of the the

2341
04:22:33,727 --> 04:22:36,031
The thing being in any one location

2342
04:22:36,287 --> 04:22:37,823
So this is

2343
04:22:39,103 --> 04:22:40,895
In case you wanted to

2344
04:22:41,151 --> 04:22:41,919
See that

2345
04:22:43,455 --> 04:22:46,783
Specifically to Alan that's kind of the recap there

2346
04:22:47,295 --> 04:22:49,599
Change that so it's a little bit more restrictive

2347
04:22:49,855 --> 04:22:55,999
I'm so here you can see that like chances are it's probably somewhere here and probably somewhere here the one thing I thought

2348
04:22:56,255 --> 04:22:58,815
Thought that was really unusual was that the

2349
04:22:59,071 --> 04:23:05,215
I was able to approximate the distance really well and like we measured with a tape measure and it was accurate within like 23cm

2350
04:23:05,471 --> 04:23:09,567
But the actual like up down position of the the

2351
04:23:10,079 --> 04:23:13,407
What do you call them this was not quite as good

2352
04:23:13,663 --> 04:23:15,199
Lighthouse was not quite as good

2353
04:23:20,319 --> 04:23:26,463
Two places at once we use to lighthouses that wants if that's what you're asking we're trying to find location of both

2354
04:23:26,719 --> 04:23:27,487
Lighthouses

2355
04:23:35,167 --> 04:23:40,799
Yan are all if you're still in here I really don't want to know do I need to send the stator or do I need to

2356
04:23:41,311 --> 04:23:43,103
Just send the really short thing

2357
04:23:45,151 --> 04:23:47,199
I don't necessarily know

2358
04:23:48,735 --> 04:23:51,295
Oh whatever I'll just send the shorts thing and we'll see what happens

2359
04:24:15,103 --> 04:24:17,407
Oh you know what I need to plug the

2360
04:24:17,663 --> 04:24:19,711
Bring back in

2361
04:24:47,103 --> 04:24:48,895
Everything was static

2362
04:24:50,175 --> 04:24:55,039
No emotion at all there is somebody else who wanted it with motion

2363
04:24:55,295 --> 04:25:00,415
Our who was somebody in the issue wanted me to collect some data with an emotion so I did take that

2364
04:25:00,671 --> 04:25:06,815
And I do understand now that there's no way with just the headset alone for you to determine the exact location of lighthouses

2365
04:25:07,071 --> 04:25:10,655
Takes additional data because there's just really no way to

2366
04:25:10,911 --> 04:25:12,191
Resolve the

2367
04:25:12,447 --> 04:25:16,799
The shell down to an area that's much smaller than maybe a decimeter and a half

2368
04:25:17,823 --> 04:25:19,615
Cuz you already at the point where it's like

2369
04:25:20,127 --> 04:25:26,271
So precisely like it's right there but like moving the camera little bit would produce like micrometers if

2370
04:25:26,527 --> 04:25:29,343
Prince on the effect of position of the

2371
04:25:29,599 --> 04:25:30,879
Centers all man

2372
04:25:31,135 --> 04:25:33,183
Helena

2373
04:25:33,439 --> 04:25:39,583
Huot's you get a chance he's probably just re-watched the first part of this live stream because just the very first B it

2374
04:25:39,839 --> 04:25:41,119
It kind of goes into

2375
04:25:41,631 --> 04:25:42,655
All of that status

2376
04:25:43,935 --> 04:25:44,959
Okay

2377
04:25:46,495 --> 04:25:48,031
Let us try this again

2378
04:26:31,039 --> 04:26:32,319
Did you record the cursor apart

2379
04:26:35,135 --> 04:26:38,207
I know I think we did record that was Paul we were recording

2380
04:26:38,463 --> 04:26:44,607
Oh yeah okay Allen you might not want to watch the very first few minutes

2381
04:26:44,863 --> 04:26:46,655
And then he came out with a solution

2382
04:26:47,935 --> 04:26:49,983
Switch to buy 5 minutes

2383
04:26:57,919 --> 04:27:00,735
What is the end goal of this they want to know why

2384
04:27:00,991 --> 04:27:03,039
Nope I won't know why sorry

2385
04:27:51,679 --> 04:27:53,215
Not sure exactly what he was

2386
04:27:53,727 --> 04:27:54,751
Talk about but

2387
04:27:55,007 --> 04:27:55,519
Quesadilla

2388
04:28:00,383 --> 04:28:00,895
Probably

2389
04:28:01,151 --> 04:28:01,919
XVideos

2390
04:28:39,295 --> 04:28:40,063
Bomber

2391
04:28:54,143 --> 04:28:57,727
So what do I actually have to send this to tell to get me the configuration

2392
04:29:02,335 --> 04:29:06,943
I was trying to find lighthouses right now I'm just trying to figure out how to

2393
04:29:09,759 --> 04:29:11,039
Get the Watchmen

2394
04:29:11,295 --> 04:29:12,575
To tell me there are

2395
04:29:15,903 --> 04:29:17,439
They'll need their config files

2396
04:29:23,327 --> 04:29:24,095
Nothing though

2397
04:29:32,543 --> 04:29:35,615
I'm really confused by this one thing though if anybody

2398
04:29:40,735 --> 04:29:43,551
Particularly use 2 USB I've never seen anything where

2399
04:29:49,439 --> 04:29:50,207
FF

2400
04:29:52,255 --> 04:29:53,791
Okay I'll buy that

2401
04:29:55,327 --> 04:29:56,351
Cosme

2402
04:29:58,143 --> 04:30:02,495
So no I don't understand how that works it's like sending a message that's empty

2403
04:30:02,751 --> 04:30:05,823
But then it's getting data back on a control out message

2404
04:30:07,871 --> 04:30:08,895
Never seen that

2405
04:30:10,175 --> 04:30:11,711
I don't understand how that works

2406
04:30:26,303 --> 04:30:29,375
Yes in fact I am wire sharking this USB connection

2407
04:30:30,399 --> 04:30:32,191
That is how I'm looking at what I mom

2408
04:30:32,447 --> 04:30:33,471
Doing right here

2409
04:30:34,239 --> 04:30:34,751
In the code

2410
04:30:39,871 --> 04:30:40,383
Part of

2411
04:30:43,711 --> 04:30:44,479
Salt so

2412
04:30:44,735 --> 04:30:45,503
Goats bar shark

2413
04:30:45,759 --> 04:30:48,831
Is using USB pcap or USB monitor one of them

2414
04:30:49,087 --> 04:30:52,415
But Wireshark totally understands exactly what you're talkin about

2415
04:32:29,695 --> 04:32:30,975
God send the control out

2416
04:32:34,815 --> 04:32:37,887
See what I can compare the official valve thing to mine

2417
04:32:38,399 --> 04:32:40,703
ISO game request is 21

2418
04:32:41,215 --> 04:32:42,751
Requested 9

2419
04:32:43,263 --> 04:32:44,287
Caillou 3ff

2420
04:32:46,079 --> 04:32:48,895
00 64

2421
04:32:50,943 --> 04:32:53,247
Okay I guess I'll send one of 64 length

2422
04:33:08,095 --> 04:33:10,399
Turn 64's let's see what that looks like

2423
04:33:15,519 --> 04:33:17,311
21:9 3ff

2424
04:33:18,079 --> 04:33:22,431
00 64 but then it sends the data fragment immediately versus in his stuff

2425
04:33:22,943 --> 04:33:24,223
It sounds that later

2426
04:33:28,575 --> 04:33:30,879
Why would his message have that later

2427
04:33:32,927 --> 04:33:34,463
Oh whatever I'll just copy it

2428
04:34:13,887 --> 04:34:14,911
Are you guys in chat

2429
04:34:17,727 --> 04:34:18,751
Everyone's talking about

2430
04:34:20,543 --> 04:34:22,079
Dementia

2431
04:34:31,551 --> 04:34:35,391
David school project has actually been importing virtual.boy 25

2432
04:34:43,583 --> 04:34:45,375
I've got to work. One

2433
04:35:10,207 --> 04:35:14,047
Okay I'm sending seriously the same thing right now why is this not working

2434
04:35:26,335 --> 04:35:27,103
Obviously YouTube

2435
04:35:49,375 --> 04:35:50,399
Halt to

2436
04:35:54,239 --> 04:35:54,751
That

2437
04:35:55,519 --> 04:35:56,543
That's weird

2438
04:35:58,591 --> 04:36:00,383
Oh wait no now it's fine

2439
04:36:01,663 --> 04:36:02,175
No

2440
04:36:08,831 --> 04:36:10,879
No it is it's getting fault - 9

2441
04:36:19,327 --> 04:36:20,095
That's

2442
04:36:20,863 --> 04:36:21,887
Really confusing

2443
04:36:27,519 --> 04:36:31,615
It's all so confusing cuz it's soon as I sent that message the Washman just turns off

2444
04:36:35,711 --> 04:36:36,735
The code for naptime

2445
04:36:44,415 --> 04:36:46,463
Clearly that's not what it wants to talk about

2446
04:36:59,519 --> 04:37:00,543
Do you want to send it blank

2447
04:37:01,823 --> 04:37:03,359
Wow in the world

2448
04:37:04,639 --> 04:37:05,663
Stop turning off

2449
04:37:18,463 --> 04:37:18,975
I don't get it

2450
04:37:19,999 --> 04:37:21,791
I think I'm sending the same message

2451
04:37:22,303 --> 04:37:23,071
Or something

2452
04:37:26,143 --> 04:37:27,935
Stop insulting The Vibes mother

2453
04:37:28,959 --> 04:37:30,495
Wait did I ever insult

2454
04:37:31,775 --> 04:37:34,847
Alan other than that one day that I didn't know it was Allen

2455
04:37:38,687 --> 04:37:41,759
I don't know what you're saying over USB would be probably is holding its mother

2456
04:37:51,999 --> 04:37:54,303
I don't want to talk to you no more

2457
04:37:54,559 --> 04:38:00,703
Send it anything it's like I don't know since being -9 and then turns off Luckett just turned

2458
04:38:00,959 --> 04:38:01,471
Stop

2459
04:38:01,727 --> 04:38:03,263
I'm not

2460
04:38:07,871 --> 04:38:09,663
Why is the thing just turning off

2461
04:39:02,399 --> 04:39:03,679
Avesta

2462
04:39:03,935 --> 04:39:04,703
Turn off

2463
04:39:08,031 --> 04:39:08,543
I'm not even

2464
04:39:08,799 --> 04:39:09,823
It still turns off

2465
04:39:21,343 --> 04:39:23,391
Get feature report

2466
04:39:50,527 --> 04:39:51,039
Are you just

2467
04:39:51,295 --> 04:39:55,135
Not allowed to read the configuration when it's wirelessly connected

2468
04:39:55,647 --> 04:39:57,183
It doesn't make any sense

2469
04:40:57,599 --> 04:41:00,159
So he was saying something about what is the actual process

2470
04:41:00,415 --> 04:41:02,719
Remind me at 4:20

2471
04:41:03,231 --> 04:41:04,511
I don't know actually

2472
04:41:07,583 --> 04:41:09,375
They come prepared right

2473
04:41:12,191 --> 04:41:18,335
Do they I don't know if they come prepared

2474
04:41:18,591 --> 04:41:21,919
Thumbs down macalino to hook up to the Box

2475
04:41:22,431 --> 04:41:23,711
Hmd whatever

2476
04:41:33,951 --> 04:41:37,279
The only time I've ever had to plug my phone into USB word update the firmware

2477
04:41:37,535 --> 04:41:39,071
How to make slime

2478
04:41:54,943 --> 04:41:56,735
Pace that matches perfectly

2479
04:42:02,367 --> 04:42:06,719
But then there is this magical control out message which makes the controller your friend

2480
04:42:07,487 --> 04:42:10,047
I do not know how this works I have never

2481
04:42:10,559 --> 04:42:11,327
Ever

2482
04:42:11,583 --> 04:42:14,655
Seen an out USB control message

2483
04:42:14,911 --> 04:42:16,447
That will accept data

2484
04:42:16,703 --> 04:42:17,215
Back

2485
04:42:27,711 --> 04:42:28,735
Now you sound like

2486
04:43:12,511 --> 04:43:17,119
Controller keeps turning off even if I don't send it that message that causes it to freak out

2487
04:43:23,519 --> 04:43:25,055
Play it stays on

2488
04:43:28,639 --> 04:43:30,687
Trust me a different message

2489
04:43:31,711 --> 04:43:32,735
I've been poking it that

2490
04:43:39,391 --> 04:43:41,439
It does actually returned an error code

2491
04:44:05,503 --> 04:44:07,807
U r b status broken pipe

2492
04:44:09,599 --> 04:44:10,623
Hospice compare these two

2493
04:44:16,255 --> 04:44:18,559
20193 FF

2494
04:44:18,815 --> 04:44:24,959
2064

2495
04:44:44,159 --> 04:44:46,975
Then if I send a control message you just dump the whole thing

2496
04:45:04,383 --> 04:45:05,919
And returns Anni Piper

2497
04:45:08,735 --> 04:45:10,271
Okay

2498
04:45:12,063 --> 04:45:15,391
What time is it here it is 203

2499
04:45:19,999 --> 04:45:26,143
I think I'm going to give up to the fridge tonight until I can figure out how to read the configuration data off of the

2500
04:45:26,399 --> 04:45:26,911
The Watchmen

2501
04:45:27,423 --> 04:45:30,751
Unless somebody online is willing to go give that a shot

2502
04:45:31,007 --> 04:45:35,359
Then the next couple steps are going to be able to slay the Watchman down on the floor

2503
04:45:35,615 --> 04:45:41,759
With the ihnb in the middle and try to resolve a little bit better the locations of the lighthouses from that

2504
04:45:43,551 --> 04:45:45,855
I was hoping that that would not be the case

2505
04:45:46,367 --> 04:45:50,207
Does anybody else have any major points or anything they'd like to talk about before

2506
04:45:50,719 --> 04:45:51,487
Closing up shop

2507
04:46:01,983 --> 04:46:04,287
Yeah I think it's time to call it quits tonight

2508
04:46:22,463 --> 04:46:23,743
They're still alive

2509
04:46:26,303 --> 04:46:29,375
Checked it and it halfway bug is still in the V6

2510
04:46:30,655 --> 04:46:33,471
Extreme I don't think I'ma do it next weekend

2511
04:46:34,495 --> 04:46:37,823
But I'm I'm hoping that you guys can start doing more

2512
04:46:38,079 --> 04:46:38,847
Work with the

2513
04:46:41,407 --> 04:46:45,247
And vika Tuesday you're talking about making sure they are all

2514
04:46:45,759 --> 04:46:46,527
Emails you

2515
04:46:53,439 --> 04:46:56,255
Neural if you have it I really

2516
04:46:58,303 --> 04:47:00,863
Hey I really want to understand so

2517
04:47:01,119 --> 04:47:06,495
What is going on can you just stick around for a minute just did the Delp me out here cuz

2518
04:47:07,007 --> 04:47:08,799
I have never seen

2519
04:47:09,311 --> 04:47:11,359
Aur bhi control message

2520
04:47:11,615 --> 04:47:14,687
That accepts data back from the device used to be out

2521
04:47:14,943 --> 04:47:18,271
You are bee control message that accepts data from the device

2522
04:47:18,783 --> 04:47:22,367
And that's what I'm think I'm seeing here where I think you're sending it

2523
04:47:22,623 --> 04:47:24,927
20193 FF

2524
04:47:25,183 --> 04:47:26,719
564

2525
04:47:27,487 --> 04:47:30,047
But you're not sending any data

2526
04:47:31,327 --> 04:47:32,095
And

2527
04:47:32,351 --> 04:47:35,423
All the tapping is for getting data back from the device

2528
04:47:37,215 --> 04:47:43,359
Does seriously like does anybody have any idea what's going on with that because I have no idea

2529
04:47:43,615 --> 04:47:46,431
I have never seen anything like that

2530
04:47:54,367 --> 04:47:55,135
Nothing

2531
04:47:56,415 --> 04:47:57,183
Mural

2532
04:47:57,951 --> 04:47:58,975
Anyone

2533
04:48:09,727 --> 04:48:12,287
I have never seen a message like this

2534
04:48:15,615 --> 04:48:17,919
I have no idea why

2535
04:48:20,735 --> 04:48:23,295
I'll just have to play with it more offline I guess

2536
04:48:24,319 --> 04:48:30,463
Well thank you everybody for coming out today I'm going to close this down and then upload and it'll probably

2537
04:48:30,719 --> 04:48:31,999
I'll be ready mid day tomorrow

2538
04:48:33,791 --> 04:48:34,815

2540
04:48:38,911 --> 04:48:42,495
The pictures that we made with a 3D thing we're kind of meet earlier on

2541
04:48:42,751 --> 04:48:44,799
Other than that not really much else

2542
04:48:46,847 --> 04:48:50,687
I'm going to go plug this back up in a couple minutes and make sure we didn't just totally blow

2543
04:48:50,943 --> 04:48:54,783
Away the Watchman or something but it is still green so can't be that bad

2544
04:48:56,831 --> 04:48:58,367
And

2545
04:48:59,391 --> 04:49:04,255
Oh hey no dear all we got like all the wireless packet stuff Dakota that's all fine

2546
04:49:04,767 --> 04:49:08,095
I just want to get a copy of the config off is all I'm after

2547
04:49:14,239 --> 04:49:18,591
Yeah what is going on how in the world do you have a control message that

2548
04:49:19,615 --> 04:49:20,383
Just don't know

2549
04:49:26,783 --> 04:49:30,623
Okay sorry for this being another anti-climactic closing to another

2550
04:49:31,135 --> 04:49:33,695
Great deal of effort

2551
04:49:34,207 --> 04:49:35,743

This is hacking this is what you

2554
04:49:41,375 --> 04:49:42,655
Should expect right now

2555
04:49:44,703 --> 04:49:48,287
Disappointment in the tears of those who are attempting to

2556
04:49:48,543 --> 04:49:50,591
Do anything before progress

2557
04:49:55,455 --> 04:50:00,063
Got it okay so you just don't want to mess with anything in the Wi-Fi thing I a k

2558
04:50:00,831 --> 04:50:02,623
Well thank you everyone for coming out

2559
04:50:03,903 --> 04:50:08,767
I do have to let it run for like another 10 seconds to clear out the buffer

2560
04:50:09,791 --> 04:50:10,303
Yeah

2561
04:50:12,095 --> 04:50:14,143
