Hello hello Ramayan

3
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Still being called Jackie also another thing I just realised

4
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
I'm going to want to try the forgot

5
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816

00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616

8
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Just checking

00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416

11
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Classic

12
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Are you actually working on the project

13
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
I'm related projects

14
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Unless you are one of work at work I'm trying

15
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,568
What's the latest with the arm pi and display

16
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
That makes sense

17
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Right now

18
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
And then go back to stop

19
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
The camera

20
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
We can also really do is start with the

21
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
2 probably

22
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
So I guess this probably half an hour doing with this cos it's just something I wanted to do and that's it

23
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:34,016
The chat room that we have right here and stream it to

24
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Still hard sorry I guess we can but what that means

25
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
Real estate on my screen that you guys can say

26
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080

00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952

Austria

Is that maybe there is a way

165
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
Because I was right at the age

166
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752

Still like you have codes spawn a new script which then once that to the

176
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,256
Actually like you

00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,912

321
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,791
Annoying

00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:24,991
So I don't know what you said it

323
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,063
Ok this is it

324
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,463

325
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,535

335
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,887

01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
My playback

385
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
Hack

386
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:34,079
Play back

387
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,479
Goodnight

388
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,879
Between the eye and you DAB I've been having some issues

389
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:28,095
It's fine

390
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:34,495
So this is happening

391
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:40,895
Starts around this

392
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
Over here in movies things around

393
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:07,263
E.ON

394
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,663
Syria live playback

395
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:47,967
Really wrong

396
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
What's this mean to do that

397
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:12,287
Play bachata

398
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,039
My cal

399
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:31,231
There we go check that out so it's actually playing that the day that was recorded through lights

400
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:37,631
With the timing information and everything and actually works perfectly

401
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:44,031
You're very happy about that thank you I'll buy now friendship for adding Guardian

402
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,103
Pakistan

403
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,151
That was the

404
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:54,271
Ok next thing

405
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:05,279
Meat ok so what's he here

406
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:11,679
You saying there is no party there is no way to say don't celebrate because

407
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:18,079
Is the poses always based on a calculation in particular output from the Poacher

408
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:31,135
If you override the White House positions

409
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,535
Every time

410
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,935
Information hose information is still there

411
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:50,335
It should probably

412
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:56,735
Accidents while that is actually correct it should probably though

413
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:15,935
What are you doing you need more Airport

414
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:22,335
Because

415
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:28,735
Would you prove me that that we really shouldn't be sending a

416
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:35,135
We shouldn't be recalibrated get the calibration data is re building

417
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,543
Reminder houses

418
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,895
Light

419
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:03,807
Help

420
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
Temperature

421
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
S'more

422
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:47,071
Stop

423
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:06,271
I'm ok with doing

424
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:12,671
Simple post-test the lighthouses are both with zerozero.pt straight up

425
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:19,071
And then we're going to run against the database coming out

426
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:27,775
So in this one I would want to manually configure lighthouses to do

427
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:34,175
Market as calibrated do we not have a

428
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:46,975
Don't do the calibration

429
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:53,375
Hey Josh

430
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,879
The life survive the side

431
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:24,095
Live survive the sides

432
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:25,535
It definitely doesn't decide the calibration based on

433
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:38,335
Decide what it needs to do it doesn't need to do

434
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:04,191
TV stage I guess we could just forcibly set that

435
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,239
5

436
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:12,383
That would be in that age

437
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:46,943
Play time to revive caldinez

438
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
See hear

439
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:34,047
Right now

440
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,423
I'm happy with that

441
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,639
What's check here

442
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:17,055
I'm really cool

443
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:24,223
Pointers actually knows begin with

444
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:31,135
I need some way of telling lies please don't want to do my own thing

445
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:47,775
Let's see how it's done

446
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:56,223
Install Siri

447
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,855
Callum solenoid on in

448
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,927
So I never do the install

449
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,791
I never do this

450
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,583
What happens

451
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:31,295
Thank you tell me I'm an idiot I just saw that now you probably said that before I found

452
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:37,695
See hear

453
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:44,095
What's a kiss really like to do is

454
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:50,495
Opposed

455
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:55,871
What makes your actually getting data

456
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:26,847
The angle functions coming back

457
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:22,143
That's good

458
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
I could do

459
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:34,943
Add Amazon

460
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,343
Thinking about it actually is I was doing your sister live stream here but but I think I want to do is Piper

461
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:47,743
Turn off and then have the Script itself people timer

462
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:54,143

01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:02,751
Ok turn by disco not getting executed

469
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:14,015
Are you getting to the point rushing the video in the sand

470
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,999
Crazy

471
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,351
Stable

472
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:35,007
Actually you know we could turn this into a livestream showing how to make a YouTube video

473
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:46,015

01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:34,143
Stairs prepping at getting into

476
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:42,079
Why is light surveying

477
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:11,007
Please

On the definition of opposable seems like

584

Open source platform will let us do

585
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:57,952
Crazy stuff including running a lighthouse based racking stuff on things like embedded device

586
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:04,352
And that's really one of the big targets the other target is to have it run on really low and

587

588
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:17,152

More time with me just chilling over it and I really want to do a livestream

620
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,936
Yeah we might just want to go switch to that then

621
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,336
Turn the light on

Simple pose cast I would just update the Lighthouse positions in here

655
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:23,616
Give me 1000 no rotation I guess

656
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,200
Be right back

657
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,152

Can we have utility functions for the typos

666
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:35,872
Also we should probably comment right here what the definition for a no rotation

667
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:42,272
Just checking it supposed p0001

668
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:44,320

Can you use this

684
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:07,936
I have made an example of one of just an ADR

685
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:14,336
So we could do like this but have three different colours hey Josh Allen

686
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:21,248
Let's go figure out which lighthouse this one is

687

Booking app

688
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,576

01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,560
I didn't think that you were serious

694
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:11,168
Call Andy phone

695
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,568

Which I don't care what you think it's like you

698
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,344
Just wrong

699
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:32,160
This is pretty accurate

700
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,208
Actually that

701
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,488
Incredible

702
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608

703
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,912
Play another accurate would like

704
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:48,800
If I hold it still it's pretty stable and I'm moving a little bit it's really stable locally

705
01:53:54,688 --> 01:54:00,832
Cos I don't think it does everyone for some reason

706
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:08,256
Every round

707
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:22,336
It's nearly as fast as coming in from the Lighthouse there hey

708
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,104
What the heck

709
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:29,504
That's ok so Josh do you know much about which way

Turn the sisters I don't really remember myself

711
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:40,256
Hi sweet

712
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,984
So the intruder by that people usually will describe is they will say think of it

713
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:56,384
Is the axis being defined by x y and z and the amount of rotation has been defined by W

714
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,456
Accept the amount of rotation is kind of

715
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:04,832
What was strange because it's like X squared plus Y squared plus Y squared 1 - they're so

716
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:09,696
Playlist

717
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,512

719
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:16,864
Don't know

720
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,680
What's really

721
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:25,824
Confused all the do we might be able to use this to figure out with what they could turn Ian's are

722
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:35,040
I'll get this to represent in alternian

723
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:44,000
Loungewear

724
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:47,072
No they're not just axis angle

725
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,352
So

726
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,888
No I think that

727
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,472
If I tried explaining it would just be the blind leading the blind

728
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:04,480
Ok right now I think this is a normal rotation

729
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:18,304
Whose laptop is on the couch

730
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:32,128
That was absolutely no sense to me because it feels like America

731
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:42,624
Play I hold it like

732
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,120

734
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:59,264
Me and that's confusing

735
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:08,480
James Stewart as the access into a Dev

736
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:11,808

01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:14,368

739
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:36,384
So just so you guys know the Lighthouse is up there

740
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,944
I'm trying to rotate

741
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:48,416
I am so confused right now if I hold it like this then it's 00

742
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,952
01

743
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:03,008
I'm so confused

744
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:15,552
0001 it would mean that

745
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:20,928
The minus x axis on the HTC headset on a bike headset is

746
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,976
Going into the Lighthouse

747
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:28,352

Early on the extension architecture esp32

756
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:01,120
Example

757
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:07,520
Using assembly functions you can get in and I'll tell you the time exactly to process your text

758
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:12,384
Turn light 3 assembly instructions it's like a built-in aspect of the processor

759
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:17,504
I am

760
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:23,392
C c o u n t

761
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:45,664
So

762
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,456
So I'm still thoroughly confused

763
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:29,440
Ok so we have to Jack goes along with one side of Jan

764
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,720
Total side Quest

765
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:38,400
The the idea is were trying to figure out some sort of unified

766
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:43,520
Operate all of the poses within a poster with them like to live is basically

767
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:49,152
Systematics all the angles from giving my own house and then figures out where an object is in 3D space

768
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:52,224
From all of this information

769
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:58,624
And the second part of the second injector today is 4th year to get the esp32

770
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,160
Reading with the

771
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,952
The

772
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,768
Ask

773
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:12,960
3633

774
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:15,264
Just be to read the

775
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,288
Read the date

776
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:23,712
If you want to display a calibrate it will tell you the lighthouses in the track objects as team

777
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:25,504
Lighthouse

778
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:27,552
I understand

779
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,320
Quiet

780
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:32,160
I really wanted to be intuitive like mathematically

781
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,328
Set alarm

782
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:51,360
What's the least look at Turvey Tory and get a feel for arm

783
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:59,296
Play Catherine this will be the figure out

784
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,064
Sorry

785
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:07,744
Because I like Mike are you are you for real

786
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,024
Actually

787
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:13,632
Like when you said plus expired

788
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:25,408
I just wondering if you do just double check what we think is the the the

789
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:31,808
Turn off the Onion

790
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:02,016
First and then we can verify

791
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:05,344
So under registration by age

792
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,608
Interesting

793
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:23,264
It says Katrina's queue XYZ which I am now inclined to believe but let's just

794
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:24,032
Play anyway

795
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:29,664
Aqw equals

796
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:42,720
Thanks bye

797
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:30,496
I'm still my Kirby the crazy thing I'm having

798
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:43,296
The

799
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:05,056
Actually know that there

800
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:28,096
Oh no that is actually wrong

801
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:40,896
Ok that looks nice

802
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:44,992
We hold this here

803
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,664
FFX

804
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:30,816
Do you want to keep charging those by changing the light on

805
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:37,216
You have like the song

806
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:41,056
Play nothing

807
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:46,688
Please

808
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:57,952
So far I have not found it

809
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:04,352
I don't know what size you are

810
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:17,152
Understand the light but I feel like if I said

811
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:23,552
The Lighthouse 300

812
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:35,072
Ok now it should be

813
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:41,216
That's probably what was going on

814
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:48,896
The rotation to b0001 instead of 1000

815
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:59,392
Are use a Sunday we using the lights

816
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:05,792
On my own

817
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:12,192
That's interesting to 0 or 100

818
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:18,592
What is being interrupted white house if I go in

819
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:24,992
So if I go

820
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:31,392
Into the Lighthouse decreases and increases

821
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:36,256
Man this rotation makes absolutely no sense to me

822
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:17,472
I am so confused there is no way that is this corner frame is right

823
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:25,920
Objects

824
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:32,320
Probably the right way to do this point

825
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:09,184
Actually do that

826
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:15,584
Cold now

827
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,984
Rod rolls overloading * 014

828
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:28,384
Change your name

829
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:34,784
Play radio

830
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:47,584
Turn on the living room lights

831
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:06,784
That's ok

832
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:53,120
Now I'm going to go create new thread

833
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:59,520
All of the representation

834
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:40,736
Stop

835
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:12,736
Window

836
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:19,136
Including a copy of 3D

837
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:42,336
Am I doing wrong

838
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:55,136
Turn the light on

839
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:17,152
A picture of a wall of lights

840
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:23,552
Open

841
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:29,952
Only vaguely

842
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:36,352
Yeah

843
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:49,152
Ok do that

844
02:16:55,808 --> 02:17:01,952
Does the plane on bedroom light

845
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:14,752
Sometimes

846
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:40,352
Directions

847
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,872
Why

848
02:18:56,128 --> 02:19:02,016
Thread

849
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:08,416
Should be able to set up some basic 3D stuff

850
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:12,512
I would like to make sure it's really

851
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:25,056
Kg lb

852
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:39,136
I need to look at

853
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:21,376
Show me

854
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:27,008
001

855
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:33,408
200

856
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:39,808
001010

857
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:46,208
Put that way on it is like we are inside the White House

858
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:50,304
Set the doesn't really work because

859
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:54,912
Exit off for some reason

860
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:34,336
Stew

861
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:40,736
Access for a long time

862
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:47,136
So apparently

863
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:53,536
It's wrong I don't disagree ok

864
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:19,136
Plus s plus XL buy now

865
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:25,536
Possibly

866
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:31,936
The lighthouse on the ground and stood up and then

867
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:38,336
Imagine of Ray shooting for Friday and that is called the

868
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:51,136
Turn the volume room

869
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:57,536
Lights

870
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:45,152
What's the least something to me know what the world is going on

871
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:51,552
I'm going to go

872
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:21,888
TTR

873
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:01,824
Ok

874
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:08,224
I will reach out the thing as

875
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:20,512
Hi guys ok sorry about that so there's two things were going to be doing tonight

876
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:26,912
2 millibar cyclist

877
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:33,312
I want to do this one

878
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:39,712
Please try and come up with some sort of standard for the poses in so far as the rotation and

879
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:46,112
Position output from

880
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:52,512
Sitting up with like pointing up where is the Lighthouse relative to

881
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:54,560
Dad dad

882
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:56,352
Where is the club

883
02:29:56,608 --> 02:30:02,752
5 headset relative to that lighthouse looking up

884
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:09,152
Poses with them Lights On by using the same right down the standard so we can actually pay attention to it

885
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:15,552
Everywhere

886
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:21,952
He's going to be working with esp32 and being able to monitor a position of a

887
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:22,976
TS

888
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:29,376
3362 3633 and esp32

889
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:35,776
Hopefully I might take

890
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:43,200
Rear A21 still and you really want it all on the esp32

891
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:45,760
Workout guys excess

892
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:53,184
You know what I'm doing is I'm trying to come up with some sort of way visually understanding

893
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:57,792
What would actually be coming out of the

894
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:01,888
The data from the posters

895
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:33,376
So right now I'm doing

896
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:36,448
Look like

897
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:57,440
Right now I'm just really basic stuff

898
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:24,320
Josh to that makes sense

899
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:39,072
So

900
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:38,464
Problem is that the posters themselves we don't really have a good way

901
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:44,864
Looking into them and understanding what Corner train everything is operating at

902
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:51,264
Settle line

903
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:18,400
Good call

904
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:24,800
Thanks

905
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:37,344
Calling sound

906
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:01,920
That shouldn't be an issue

907
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:37,504
White Crow

908
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:39,808
Amanda on here

909
02:36:58,752 --> 02:37:00,544
Do you want the bathroom last

910
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:08,736
Thank you

911
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:22,048
Matrix is breaking

912
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:30,496
Like crazy

913
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:36,896
Where is here

914
02:37:56,352 --> 02:38:02,496
This is just computer science I guess just the fact that I'm sitting here forever

915
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:07,360
Tell me something really like getting two lines to show up on a screen

916
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:09,664
What the heck

917
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:51,136
Use the Corner train I'm used to

918
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:21,088
What am I doing wrong here

919
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:33,888
Oh my gosh what is the

920
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:41,568
Should not be hard

921
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:47,456
Should not be hard at all

922
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,528
Now

923
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:29,184
My perspective nature supposed

924
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:35,584
Spell

925
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:41,728
That's interesting but

926
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:48,128
Send in the code I need in order to

927
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:55,808
Wow

928
02:40:56,064 --> 02:41:00,672
How's my activator at hose

929
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:32,672
Can be unsavory

930
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:47,776
Aspects

931
02:41:54,432 --> 02:42:00,576
Why is screen excellence

932
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:13,376
Oh my gosh

933
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:19,008
Providing the right values

934
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:21,824
What's

935
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:23,264
So what I need to do now as I need to write a function

936
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:29,664
Light xyz

937
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:36,064
Connect to my TV

938
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:37,504
Suggesting you get real-time yet is that

939
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:45,696
Turn off in 30-minutes

940
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:03,104
It was like this

941
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:07,200
Use xmpp to sync your changes

942
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:13,600
Once

943
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:18,720
You probably spent a very long time getting into work

944

1133
03:20:58,879 --> 03:21:05,023
I seem to find it on eBay

1134
03:21:05,279 --> 03:21:11,423
Sorry dude

1135
03:21:11,679 --> 03:21:17,823
Some catching up to do

1136
03:21:21,407 --> 03:21:27,551
I just realised I have no idea with apply closed

1137
03:21:27,807 --> 03:21:32,159
That would mean that you would wanted to

1138
03:21:33,695 --> 03:21:38,047
Being the poses local for hernia frame and then

1139
03:21:38,559 --> 03:21:41,631
It's like a point in closes local corner frame

1140
03:21:41,887 --> 03:21:45,983
Where is applied to a location first

1141
03:21:47,007 --> 03:21:53,151
And then shifted by the amount that the thing on

1142
03:21:53,407 --> 03:21:59,551
Yeah I really need is some way to

1143
03:21:59,807 --> 03:22:05,951
I really need a way to I don't remember

1144
03:22:06,207 --> 03:22:12,351

Anthem

1148
03:22:49,727 --> 03:22:51,775
I guess I'm just trying to do it

1149
03:23:05,343 --> 03:23:11,487
By the way Justin Argentino any code you paste into all the chat on the channel automat

1150
03:23:11,743 --> 03:23:17,887
Play becomes no no no

1151
03:23:18,143 --> 03:23:24,287
Having licence and you automatically transfer copyright ownership to me

1152
03:23:41,439 --> 03:23:44,767
This works that way

1153
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:51,167
Oh I see I'm going to change down on the bed

1154
03:23:57,567 --> 03:24:01,919
Mourning the loss of my rotation code

1155
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:06,271
Ok

1156
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:07,551
Thanks

1157
03:24:20,607 --> 03:24:23,679
I'm really confused right now

1158
03:24:25,215 --> 03:24:28,031
I don't want I don't think that's what I want to do

1159
03:24:30,847 --> 03:24:34,175
No I really don't think that's what I like you

1160
03:24:49,535 --> 03:24:55,679
Help

1161
03:24:57,471 --> 03:24:59,775
Half

1163
03:25:05,663 --> 03:25:06,687
That's terrifying

1164
03:25:06,943 --> 03:25:10,015
Ok

1165
03:25:20,767 --> 03:25:26,911
Actually there is a funny story

1166
03:25:27,167 --> 03:25:33,311
Salon in college I have password in

1167
03:25:39,967 --> 03:25:46,111
When you reverse engineer or when you when you tried to crack it with the Rainbow tables I think it was under

1168
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:52,511
Turn one second between when you gave it the hash and and when it

1169
03:25:52,767 --> 03:25:58,911
Cracked

1170
03:25:59,167 --> 03:26:05,311
It was also bad password

1171
03:26:05,567 --> 03:26:08,895
Is it bad

1172
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:11,967
No it was not put it was

1173
03:26:12,479 --> 03:26:18,623
5 letters

1174
03:26:18,879 --> 03:26:25,023
Now as I discovered ok I need a real password

1175
03:26:34,495 --> 03:26:38,079
The end as an MP file system

1176
03:26:38,335 --> 03:26:43,967
Which is one of them

1177
03:26:44,223 --> 03:26:50,367
Absolutely public

1178
03:26:50,623 --> 03:26:56,767
DFS

1179
03:26:57,023 --> 03:27:03,167
Set alarm for 5

1180
03:27:09,823 --> 03:27:13,663
Don't give you

1181
03:27:14,431 --> 03:27:20,575
UK use any of the compromise mb52 get the source material

1182
03:27:23,135 --> 03:27:29,279
Yes

1183
03:27:31,583 --> 03:27:37,727
The plaintext I thought you could modify the Playtex in such a way that

1184
03:27:37,983 --> 03:27:39,263
Keep the same hash

1185
03:27:39,519 --> 03:27:44,127
Bob Willis

1186
03:27:44,383 --> 03:27:49,503
The shower is the moment they did they only have one specific

1187
03:27:51,551 --> 03:27:54,367
Versions of files with the same hash

1188
03:27:56,159 --> 03:27:59,487
The first one

1189
03:28:02,047 --> 03:28:07,423
Like you say anything

1190
03:28:09,215 --> 03:28:15,359
File

1191
03:28:16,383 --> 03:28:22,527
Very much

1192
03:28:26,111 --> 03:28:30,207
Hi Josh this is what I want to do in concert

1193
03:28:30,463 --> 03:28:33,535
Also I'm really concerned by watches am in here

1194
03:28:35,583 --> 03:28:36,863
Where

1195
03:28:37,119 --> 03:28:40,191
Supposably a unicode symbol somewhere in here

1196
03:28:41,215 --> 03:28:46,335
Rewrite it manually

1197
03:28:46,591 --> 03:28:48,639
How is that

1198
03:28:48,895 --> 03:28:55,039
I can't be on this out of the YouTube

1199
03:28:56,575 --> 03:29:02,719
And somehow

1200
03:29:02,975 --> 03:29:04,511
The cause

1201
03:29:04,767 --> 03:29:08,863
Everything beyond that point three spaces instead of 4

1202
03:29:09,375 --> 03:29:11,679
Fix it

1203
03:29:11,935 --> 03:29:18,079
Play the top of the fire was fine

1204
03:29:20,127 --> 03:29:24,735
I just had to ruin file by hand because

1205
03:29:28,575 --> 03:29:30,623
Caprice

1206
03:29:31,647 --> 03:29:34,207
Why

1207
03:29:34,463 --> 03:29:38,815
What is going on here

1208
03:29:39,327 --> 03:29:41,887
Breaking in

1209
03:29:56,991 --> 03:29:58,527
Heart

1210
03:30:12,351 --> 03:30:14,399
Wow it's just Host

1211
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:55,103
So Joshua I really want to do here is I'm trying to

1212
03:30:55,615 --> 03:31:00,735
To take a point and then I want to rotate that point by the Britannia

1213
03:31:00,991 --> 03:31:07,135
And I want to translate it by the translation of The Pogues

1214
03:31:14,815 --> 03:31:18,399
I think that's the right way to do it if you want to check me

1215
03:31:28,639 --> 03:31:33,503
Updated rather than just image

1216
03:31:40,415 --> 03:31:46,303
Use it to compile lasagna

1217
03:31:47,327 --> 03:31:48,863
You are a terrifying man

1218
03:31:49,119 --> 03:31:55,263
No no no you just terrified me

1219
03:31:55,519 --> 03:32:01,663
Never never

1220
03:32:33,919 --> 03:32:36,991
Busted

1221
03:32:46,719 --> 03:32:51,327
Last few months somebody's desktop PC has been an Asus tinker board

1222
03:33:16,415 --> 03:33:18,719
Office

1223
03:33:21,535 --> 03:33:23,071
Why is the scratching

1224
03:33:44,319 --> 03:33:46,367
Alarm for 10

1225
03:33:47,135 --> 03:33:50,207
What's going on

1226
03:34:18,623 --> 03:34:24,767
A friend of mine had a think of the word eight £30

1227
03:34:25,023 --> 03:34:26,815
5.4 monitor

1228
03:34:27,071 --> 03:34:29,631
To down on my laptop broke

1229
03:34:30,655 --> 03:34:35,263
2 months

1230
03:34:35,775 --> 03:34:37,567
Depressing

1231
03:34:38,079 --> 03:34:44,223
Interesting actually turns out

1232
03:35:42,847 --> 03:35:48,479
Apparently he was able to get I really don't know the 80s think of Warriors so not really know what

1233
03:35:50,015 --> 03:35:51,295
What's that is

1234
03:35:51,551 --> 03:35:52,319
Off

1235
03:35:54,623 --> 03:35:58,719
YouTube

1236
03:36:08,191 --> 03:36:11,775
Never called why is this cold never called

1237
03:36:31,487 --> 03:36:37,631
Come on man or Linux system for composite video

1238
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:53,503
I wonder if I having the chat inside of his terminal hear people are less inclined to spend because this

1239
03:37:05,023 --> 03:37:09,119
Speak

1240
03:37:09,887 --> 03:37:11,423
Non crown whatever

1241
03:37:18,847 --> 03:37:20,895
Hi

1242
03:37:38,047 --> 03:37:44,191
That's really interesting

1243
03:38:02,367 --> 03:38:06,975
Now it looks like it's out of order thing going on

1244
03:38:07,231 --> 03:38:10,047
Like

1245
03:38:15,935 --> 03:38:22,079
Like the data is going into the thing before the date is right now

1246
03:38:22,335 --> 03:38:26,175
So what's going on is one of the drivers get initiated before

1247
03:38:26,431 --> 03:38:29,759
The button Q summer is being populated

1248
03:38:30,783 --> 03:38:35,647
So this stuff looks like it's going to have to be executed beforehand

1249
03:38:44,095 --> 03:38:47,167
How old is Skipton if it was not

1250
03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:56,383
B&Q

1251
03:38:56,639 --> 03:38:58,943
Make sure everything's fine with you

1252
03:39:05,599 --> 03:39:11,231
Interesting Bob wouldn't come up until now

1253
03:40:29,055 --> 03:40:33,407
So I know what's going on here is having a sad day

1254
03:40:33,663 --> 03:40:36,479
Final of Watchmen

1255
03:40:37,247 --> 03:40:39,039
Turn LEGO tower game

1256
03:42:15,551 --> 03:42:21,695
Generally is saying that he are is overclocking his

1257
03:42:21,951 --> 03:42:28,095
Online

1258
03:42:42,431 --> 03:42:47,807
OK get Revived sitting still

1259
03:42:48,831 --> 03:42:51,647
What's in the alphabet

1260
03:43:00,351 --> 03:43:02,655
Also buy translate first

1261
03:43:11,871 --> 03:43:18,015
No ok so what we have as we have the union of an object so we have

1262
03:43:18,271 --> 03:43:20,575
This is another Lighthouse

1263
03:43:23,135 --> 03:43:24,927
Are rotation and

1264
03:43:27,743 --> 03:43:29,791
Position associated with it

1265
03:43:30,047 --> 03:43:32,095
The rotation the same

1266
03:43:32,607 --> 03:43:35,935
But I am move it through 3D space

1267
03:43:36,191 --> 03:43:39,007
Like this way of this way

1268
03:43:39,263 --> 03:43:40,287
Then

1269
03:43:43,103 --> 03:43:45,663
Yes but that position is unchanged

1270
03:43:46,431 --> 03:43:51,295
Rotated I only wanted to rotate by the amount it would be surface on cervix

1271
03:43:54,879 --> 03:43:56,159
What you in

1272
03:43:56,671 --> 03:44:02,815
So why do you invert the rotation I'm worried that I'd be doing like maybe it's solving the inverse of the

1273
03:44:03,071 --> 03:44:03,839
Or something

1274
03:45:13,727 --> 03:45:18,079
I really don't understand why invading

1275
03:45:18,335 --> 03:45:21,919
Why why would we would be in Reading

1276
03:45:26,015 --> 03:45:29,599
What does protein powder actually do

1277
03:45:32,159 --> 03:45:36,767
Does this quote about get kind you get quite routine Abell

1278
03:45:45,471 --> 03:45:51,103
No no no so I'm going from space to world space

1279
03:45:51,359 --> 03:45:57,503
So what I want to do is I want to say this point on the camera

1280
03:45:57,759 --> 03:46:02,879
Local attic space is like plus 1

1281
03:46:03,135 --> 03:46:04,927
X + .5

1282
03:46:05,183 --> 03:46:11,327
Where is that in world space if I have the pose of my camera

1283
03:46:49,215 --> 03:46:55,359
Right now I'm trying to figure out why

1284
03:46:55,615 --> 03:47:01,759
Fix this code

1285
03:47:02,015 --> 03:47:04,063
Angela Taylor

1286
03:48:29,567 --> 03:48:31,103
How far along are you

1287
03:48:32,127 --> 03:48:38,271
I'm using the timer

1288
03:48:49,279 --> 03:48:52,351
Music

1289
03:49:09,759 --> 03:49:12,575
Bromley

1290
03:49:14,111 --> 03:49:15,391
Light mobius

1291
03:49:20,767 --> 03:49:24,863
Sometimes I do that serious day

1292
03:49:26,143 --> 03:49:27,423
Always down

1293
03:50:24,255 --> 03:50:27,327
Tell me I'm really confused now

1294
03:51:00,351 --> 03:51:05,215
What's going on why is default not being called

1295
03:51:27,487 --> 03:51:33,631
Are you know it's nice when people post links in the YouTube thing by click on the link

1296
03:51:33,887 --> 03:51:34,655
My thing

1297
03:51:34,911 --> 03:51:35,679
It works

1298
03:51:51,295 --> 03:51:54,111
You are doing quite rotate first

1299
03:51:57,439 --> 03:52:01,535
What's going on here camera rotation ok that makes sense

1300
03:52:01,791 --> 03:52:04,863
That's exactly what I want to do Josh

1301
03:52:05,887 --> 03:52:12,031
What is actually going on inside quattro TT

1302
03:52:16,127 --> 03:52:18,687
What what why

1303
03:52:18,943 --> 03:52:21,503
What is this Josh

1304
03:52:23,295 --> 03:52:25,087
Was very strange

1305
03:52:25,599 --> 03:52:28,159
You taking the cross product of

1306
03:52:28,927 --> 03:52:30,975
Everything now

1307
03:52:31,743 --> 03:52:37,887
Cross product of the Union and the cross product of the Union

1308
03:52:38,143 --> 03:52:38,911
V

1309
03:52:39,167 --> 03:52:40,959
What's

1310
03:52:42,239 --> 03:52:44,031
Does this work at all

1311
03:53:10,911 --> 03:53:14,239
I've definitely broken turn lights around here

1312
03:54:18,495 --> 03:54:24,639
I Never Said

1313
03:54:27,711 --> 03:54:29,759

You are actually cross product King

1320
03:55:12,255 --> 03:55:14,047

Well I will have to try and see what happens

1333
03:56:44,927 --> 03:56:48,511
Looks like it's more stable especially if we have

1334
03:56:48,767 --> 03:56:53,375
Watching off

1335
03:56:54,399 --> 03:56:56,703
That was from Mercury engine

1336
03:56:56,959 --> 03:56:58,495
HG3

1337
03:57:02,079 --> 03:57:05,919

03:57:08,735 --> 03:57:14,879
I'm doing

1340
03:57:15,391 --> 03:57:21,535

Themes of the freezer is Rocky

1346
03:58:26,815 --> 03:58:32,959

03:58:39,615 --> 03:58:45,759
Thermometer

1349
03:58:46,015 --> 03:58:52,159
I'm confident Mercury

1350
03:58:52,415 --> 03:58:58,559
Which was way better even though

1351
03:58:58,815 --> 03:59:04,959
Hey Josh

1353
03:59:11,615 --> 03:59:14,175
Number 33 was kind of like

1354
03:59:14,687 --> 03:59:20,831
Mercury to we need back in the days when people called XML was good

1355
03:59:21,087 --> 03:59:27,231
If you guys could get along

1356
03:59:27,487 --> 03:59:33,631
That was bad

1357
03:59:33,887 --> 03:59:40,031
Everybody

Really like inspiration to json

1361
03:59:59,487 --> 04:00:04,863
Pretty much of the Ripper

1362
04:00:05,119 --> 04:00:11,263
It's much positive python

1363
04:00:11,519 --> 04:00:14,335
Play cool music quotes I can just

1364
04:00:14,591 --> 04:00:15,359

Json

1366
04:00:19,455 --> 04:00:24,319
So that's all so annoying that was one of the reasons that people so

1367
04:00:24,575 --> 04:00:27,391
Brfc released a new RFC

1368

Emitting and receiving

1371

Because JavaScript is one of those things were like everybody in their brothers

1372
04:00:44,031 --> 04:00:50,175
Accept all these things without the double quotes what the heck guys this is terrible

1373
04:00:50,431 --> 04:00:56,575
And that's just now being a new guiding principle

1374
04:00:56,831 --> 04:01:02,975
Principle was Sound Liverpool received

1375
04:01:03,231 --> 04:01:09,375

Something is up with R&R

04:02:45,375 --> 04:02:51,519
Is it going to rain location understanding wrong angle

1384
04:02:51,775 --> 04:02:57,919
The whole thing is rotating around the access so I can get a better picture of what's going on

04:16:55,039 --> 04:17:01,183
So hold on

1464
04:17:01,439 --> 04:17:03,743
And then we can do a

04:17:03,999 --> 04:17:10,143
Play the recording video

1466
04:17:10,399 --> 04:17:13,983

Please turn off when it gets light out and then when it gets dark

1474
04:17:48,031 --> 04:17:49,055

04:20:00,383 --> 04:20:04,991
Hey Google would you take any number

1501
04:20:05,247 --> 04:20:07,039
Because

1502
04:20:07,807 --> 04:20:10,879
Online

1503
04:20:12,415 --> 04:20:13,951
Today afternoon forever

1504
04:20:18,047 --> 04:20:19,327
What is the capital of assyria

1505
04:20:27,775 --> 04:20:30,591
The side of this state

1506
04:20:30,847 --> 04:20:34,431
I'm basically so I can sell it

1507
04:20:34,943 --> 04:20:41,087
Turn it down

1508
04:20:45,183 --> 04:20:51,327
Because by the time you get background

1509
04:20:51,583 --> 04:20:54,655
Really fast

1510
04:20:55,167 --> 04:20:57,983
So between these parts of an and gate

1511
04:20:59,263 --> 04:21:00,543
Can we have a memory cell

1512
04:21:01,055 --> 04:21:04,639
So we should be able to build a pre-op computer if we can get enough of these

1513
04:21:04,895 --> 04:21:07,967
And tweak the the light Bolton area just right

1514
04:21:08,991 --> 04:21:10,015
Will vinegar

1515
04:21:10,271 --> 04:21:13,343
Turn on the rolling shutter you can really see it

1516
04:21:13,599 --> 04:21:16,927
So stable lights don't have a rolling shutter

1517
04:21:17,183 --> 04:21:18,207
Like this

1518
04:21:18,463 --> 04:21:23,327
But you can see that these ones because they're breaking so fast the rolling shutter

1519
04:21:23,583 --> 04:21:29,727
Makes it so that it's really apparent that they're freaking out and blinking on and off super fast

1520
04:21:30,751 --> 04:21:32,799
Lights on

1521
04:21:33,567 --> 04:21:35,103
Stop

1522
04:21:38,687 --> 04:21:41,247
Even use the tubes to the light tonight

1523
04:21:41,503 --> 04:21:42,015

04:46:40,127 --> 04:46:46,271
Somebody out there seems to understand

1690
04:46:46,527 --> 04:46:52,671
Have you ever gotten that working on a Raspberry Pi

1691
04:46:52,927 --> 04:46:59,071
Cancel

1692
04:47:12,127 --> 04:47:18,271
I'm supposed to be off-topic

1693
04:47:18,527 --> 04:47:24,671
When you can take a peek

1694
04:47:31,327 --> 04:47:37,471
Tell Rooney you are using on

1695
04:47:37,727 --> 04:47:43,871
You're using your SPC and

1696
04:47:44,127 --> 04:47:50,271
I'm sending can you 4K what can I do combination of custom outlines along with video gallery

1697
04:48:03,327 --> 04:48:07,679
You can

1698
04:48:15,615 --> 04:48:21,759
Ok you got your ex back

1699
04:48:28,927 --> 04:48:35,071
Breeders

1700
04:48:35,327 --> 04:48:38,399
Things I should probably drink with right now

1701
04:48:38,655 --> 04:48:40,447
Whitby

1702
04:48:40,703 --> 04:48:46,847
Just tried to do a different type of rotation

1703
04:48:47,103 --> 04:48:49,407
Is it going to be

1704
04:49:11,423 --> 04:49:12,703
Goes

1705
04:49:13,215 --> 04:49:18,335
Are you XYZ right ok

1706
04:49:38,559 --> 04:49:40,863
Hello

1707
04:49:46,495 --> 04:49:51,359
It's not plugged in because I use the USB cable for the camera

1708
04:49:56,991 --> 04:50:03,135
That's me

1709
04:50:09,791 --> 04:50:15,423
Extension cable

1710
04:50:16,703 --> 04:50:17,983
Waitrose Dublin

1711
04:50:46,655 --> 04:50:52,799
What is the weather like in Thailand

1712
04:51:34,015 --> 04:51:40,159
Skip

1713
04:51:46,815 --> 04:51:52,959
Google scrap this tst-622q with Dad

1714
04:51:53,215 --> 04:51:59,359
You can't use that the reason is that the mycenter produces

1715
04:51:59,615 --> 04:52:05,759
Is the carrier wave it does not produce like a nice clean like on off

1716
04:52:06,015 --> 04:52:12,159
How useful that would be to you

1717
04:52:12,415 --> 04:52:18,559
That makes me wonder what you're doing is a really I think

1718
04:52:18,815 --> 04:52:24,959
Value to have support for multiple sensors

1719
04:52:25,215 --> 04:52:29,823
Did you actually have the horse characters

1720
04:52:30,079 --> 04:52:36,223
Between those two things that seems like a problem

1721
04:52:36,479 --> 04:52:42,623
Maybe if you were using I haven't let them know you might be able

1722
04:52:42,879 --> 04:52:49,023
Use that instead to process PR

1723
04:52:49,279 --> 04:52:55,423
Then using the timers

1724
04:52:56,703 --> 04:53:02,847
Do you have

1725
04:53:03,103 --> 04:53:09,247
Set up an alarm

1726
04:53:09,503 --> 04:53:15,647
Something esp32 eskimo

1727
04:53:22,303 --> 04:53:24,863
Wacky

1728
04:53:32,031 --> 04:53:38,175
Have you guys

1729
04:53:38,431 --> 04:53:44,575
Because I have that works been out then

1730
04:53:44,831 --> 04:53:49,439
Rugby matches xdrivers accelerator are needed to make it work

1731
04:53:49,695 --> 04:53:53,535
Could you imagine if you did this in actually made a hell 2

1732
04:54:00,191 --> 04:54:06,335
Ok maco MK if I give you money to do it

1733
04:54:06,591 --> 04:54:12,735
You actually do it or there

1734
04:54:19,135 --> 04:54:25,279
It would be really cool crazy

1735
04:54:25,535 --> 04:54:31,679
Skip that's that powerful and nobody knows how to actually use a mainline Kernel on it with video accelerate

1736
04:54:31,935 --> 04:54:35,007
Literally seems crazy to me

1737
04:54:58,559 --> 04:55:04,703
32-39 Lord Ashdown

1738
04:55:04,959 --> 04:55:11,103
This particular one I believe it does it's dreams

1739
04:55:11,359 --> 04:55:17,503
Double check that it has stream in

1740
04:55:17,759 --> 04:55:23,903
That's what you really want and this one streams in it

1741
04:55:24,159 --> 04:55:28,767
Probably too slow for you

1742
04:55:29,023 --> 04:55:35,167
Is a Tom if that's a please pens on the esp32

1743
04:55:35,423 --> 04:55:36,959
To stream the data in from

1744
04:55:37,215 --> 04:55:43,359
And then it to them and then you can go read the data

1745
04:55:43,615 --> 04:55:49,759
Compare live stream through when you like an extra operated compare the frames to each other and

1746
04:55:50,015 --> 04:55:56,159
You could say clever in how you do it quickly

1747
04:55:56,415 --> 04:55:59,743
Up on the spot in down on this clock to

1748
04:55:59,999 --> 04:56:06,143
What is this something you can probably do without too much effort in the work so you could you could probably

1749
04:56:06,399 --> 04:56:08,447
And see how it goes

1750
04:56:08,703 --> 04:56:14,847
I have not worked in 9 months by 9 months ago

1751
04:56:15,359 --> 04:56:21,503
Yeah yeah

1752
04:56:21,759 --> 04:56:27,903
Making things work

1753
04:56:29,183 --> 04:56:32,511
All the lights

1754
04:56:32,767 --> 04:56:38,911
You guys drink that much

1755
04:56:47,103 --> 04:56:53,247
Did you want any of the tea

1756
04:56:55,807 --> 04:57:01,951
Is the bit left is going to be

1757
04:57:13,983 --> 04:57:20,127
Where is the try guys right now

1758
04:57:20,383 --> 04:57:26,527
O'keeffe's working on actually

1759
04:57:26,783 --> 04:57:32,927
Stream

1760
04:57:34,719 --> 04:57:40,863
Coconut milk

1761
04:57:41,119 --> 04:57:47,263
Video stream

1762
04:57:47,519 --> 04:57:53,407
If you want you can pick up alive and well known

1763
04:57:54,687 --> 04:57:59,039
This

1764
04:57:59,551 --> 04:58:04,159
They're still talking in chat about details baldi.exe driver

1765
04:58:06,207 --> 04:58:12,351
The problem with the Raspberry Pi Jamie Christie is that

1766
04:58:12,607 --> 04:58:18,751
Raspberry Pi does not support better can have more with the device

1767
04:58:19,007 --> 04:58:25,151
Does not support them at all

1768
04:58:25,407 --> 04:58:31,551
Navigate to go to work with the hardware physically cannot get that stuff without like

1769
04:58:41,791 --> 04:58:47,935
Ok

1770
04:58:52,799 --> 04:58:58,943
A proper display driver for somebody and put it already gone in schedule

1771
04:58:59,199 --> 04:59:03,039
4.17 mainline kernel

1772
04:59:04,831 --> 04:59:10,719
Hey hey hey hey release date is there anyway we can get an answer right now

1773
04:59:16,351 --> 04:59:22,495

04:59:24,543 --> 04:59:26,335
Take me to

1775
04:59:26,591 --> 04:59:30,943
45-16 is production stable

1776
04:59:31,199 --> 04:59:32,479
Thank you jail

1777
04:59:43,999 --> 04:59:47,583
Attempting to have these charge themselves

1778
05:00:04,479 --> 05:00:06,271
Yes

1779
05:00:08,575 --> 05:00:14,719
Do you want a video on my channel

1780
05:00:14,975 --> 05:00:21,119
Stream

1781
05:00:30,847 --> 05:00:36,991

Define hyper

1786
05:01:05,919 --> 05:01:12,063
Looks like it's doing a lot of other stuff in there too

1787
05:01:12,319 --> 05:01:18,463
Volume to use on light turn up

1788
05:01:18,719 --> 05:01:22,047
Yeah

1789
05:01:22,559 --> 05:01:28,703
Oh definitely no we don't want to do that

1790
05:01:28,959 --> 05:01:35,103
Turn the lights off

1791
05:01:35,359 --> 05:01:41,503
You don't want to mess with us

1792
05:01:41,759 --> 05:01:47,903
That does that

1793
05:01:48,159 --> 05:01:54,303
Filter or summer

1794
05:02:03,519 --> 05:02:09,663
USB removed USB

1795
05:02:09,919 --> 05:02:16,063

Please please be Paragon so you can Ltd

1801
05:03:16,991 --> 05:03:23,135
We know nothing

1802
05:03:23,391 --> 05:03:28,255
Double A batteries magfest employees turn

1803
05:03:28,511 --> 05:03:34,655
Emperor

1804
05:03:41,311 --> 05:03:42,079
I did forget to put

1805
05:03:42,335 --> 05:03:47,711
Volume down up to put it in there though

1806
05:04:22,527 --> 05:04:26,623
What's the time again

1807
05:04:29,439 --> 05:04:33,279
Stream in for USB

1808
05:04:34,303 --> 05:04:40,447
No it's gone forever

1809
05:04:44,799 --> 05:04:47,103
I2s stream put into USB

1810
05:04:48,127 --> 05:04:48,895
Alarm off

1811
05:04:49,663 --> 05:04:55,807
Working on a huge missing thing there

1812
05:04:56,063 --> 05:05:02,207
Probably we heard it so

1813
05:05:02,463 --> 05:05:04,255
Does Oxford FM

1814
05:05:07,071 --> 05:05:13,215
Yes that was a cool Project

1815
05:05:13,471 --> 05:05:15,775
Garden lights

1816
05:05:16,031 --> 05:05:21,151
Just happened to be calculating crimes or something

1817
05:05:22,431 --> 05:05:28,575
Actually can we just manufacturer from China

1818
05:05:28,831 --> 05:05:29,343
Turn lights

1819
05:05:29,855 --> 05:05:35,999
Light designed the garden light specifically for this purpose we would all be power

1820
05:05:36,255 --> 05:05:40,863
Turn off of work for forever

1821
05:05:41,375 --> 05:05:44,703
Remember Night Time comes to thing

1822
05:05:49,055 --> 05:05:54,175
Extra bright lights be able to adjust

1823
05:05:59,295 --> 05:06:04,159
If you half an hour prices

1824
05:06:09,023 --> 05:06:15,167
Made

1825
05:06:16,191 --> 05:06:17,983
It

1826
05:06:18,495 --> 05:06:21,823
Transistor water tolerant so

1827
05:06:23,871 --> 05:06:30,015
Everything in silicone

1828
05:06:30,271 --> 05:06:36,415
Just do nothing

1829
05:06:36,671 --> 05:06:42,815
Turn off

1830
05:06:43,071 --> 05:06:48,191
Rvt filter so you can code with Code information with colours

1831
05:06:49,471 --> 05:06:52,031
It's not too far

1832
05:06:52,287 --> 05:06:55,103
Reduce stupid stuff already man

1833
05:06:57,407 --> 05:07:03,551
Ok will be crossing the xyz

1834
05:07:25,055 --> 05:07:31,199
Feel like in the past couple years I have more than like a week without seeing

1835
05:07:31,455 --> 05:07:33,503
Stop alarm

1836
05:07:35,295 --> 05:07:41,439
I always keep forgetting with w

1837
05:07:50,911 --> 05:07:53,983
The cockerel is running

1838
05:07:59,103 --> 05:08:00,895
Lights

1839
05:08:01,151 --> 05:08:04,479
I would not put it past me to recompile it from scratch

1840
05:08:09,343 --> 05:08:10,623
You should not use it

1841
05:08:11,135 --> 05:08:17,279
I'm just not working

1842
05:08:17,535 --> 05:08:19,071
Turn off the TV

1843
05:08:23,935 --> 05:08:25,983
Create this book

1844
05:08:31,871 --> 05:08:34,431
Mind you

1845
05:08:34,943 --> 05:08:35,967
Eventually

1846
05:08:38,527 --> 05:08:42,367
No I do use the lot of stuff from the camera that's true

1847
05:08:45,439 --> 05:08:51,583
Ok you should be able to actually use that and you'll have to go which

1848
05:08:51,839 --> 05:08:55,423
Who's the couple that need to change on the

1849
05:08:55,679 --> 05:09:01,823
What's left when you configure the ice cold see you need to change a couple of lights camera and it's like

1850
05:09:02,079 --> 05:09:08,223
Can you should be able to vary

1851
05:09:08,479 --> 05:09:12,575
Use use

1852
05:09:35,871 --> 05:09:38,687
Clay Cross

1853
05:09:51,999 --> 05:09:55,839
This is awful

1854
05:10:05,055 --> 05:10:08,383
I want to keep the individual lights that simple layers are you still there

1855
05:10:08,895 --> 05:10:15,039
Red could be Clark signal on distributed by each unit drink

1856
05:10:16,831 --> 05:10:18,879
You have to

1857
05:10:19,135 --> 05:10:21,439
Like transistors

1858
05:10:23,999 --> 05:10:30,143
Bargain Jackson's gay men

1859
05:10:30,399 --> 05:10:36,543
Yes yes

1860
05:10:36,799 --> 05:10:42,943
More people who've been getting involved over the last couple of months so I'm pretty sure this is now like this way

1861
05:10:44,223 --> 05:10:47,807
Mei Mei importantly pretty high at this point

1862
05:10:48,063 --> 05:10:52,927
Definitely from me

1863
05:10:54,207 --> 05:10:56,511
White survived

1864
05:11:02,655 --> 05:11:08,287
We just made a tyre see for ourselves song

1865
05:11:09,567 --> 05:11:15,711
Hi how are you everybody is going to keep working but I feel like I'm finally starting to make progress after 5 hours online

1866
05:11:16,735 --> 05:11:19,551
Let me know how a building goes

1867
05:11:20,063 --> 05:11:22,879
Volume down

1868
05:11:25,951 --> 05:11:32,095
No no but then you said the bits to stay I just want to read the digital lens

1869
05:11:33,631 --> 05:11:37,471
Then you can just stop the tea room

1870
05:11:38,239 --> 05:11:44,383

Sorry about that

1872
05:11:47,967 --> 05:11:51,039

Parallel esp32

1875
05:12:01,023 --> 05:12:03,071
Someone out there might actually have a

Or better yet you could check out my Repo from a date in the past

1877
05:12:14,335 --> 05:12:16,639

For the night you don't want the end of my eyes I really don't want that stuff

1890
05:13:33,439 --> 05:13:35,231
Think that's the one you want

05:13:35,743 --> 05:13:38,303
That one that one

1892
05:13:38,559 --> 05:13:44,447
One of those two whichever one bills is the one you want

1893
05:14:00,575 --> 05:14:04,671
Interesting plants

1894
05:14:08,767 --> 05:14:11,071

1895
05:14:13,887 --> 05:14:17,471
2 x 220

1896
05:14:41,791 --> 05:14:44,351
Fingers crossed that's different

Currently looking into the

05:16:32,383 --> 05:16:38,527
Who's looking into the RBS

1906
05:16:38,783 --> 05:16:39,551
Right now

1907
05:16:42,111 --> 05:16:45,695
If that's cool

1908
05:16:45,951 --> 05:16:52,095
Captain's never that's ok because the cross 2D function here outputs

1909
05:16:52,351 --> 05:16:57,215
3DA

1910
05:16:57,471 --> 05:17:03,615

Hey dude thanks so much that's really cool

1913
05:17:38,431 --> 05:17:43,295
I'm picking up the wrong values that's why

1914
05:17:50,719 --> 05:17:51,743
Come on

1915
05:17:52,511 --> 05:17:55,583
The date is different and it's reasonable

1916
05:17:58,399 --> 05:18:00,447
Excellent

1917
05:18:00,703 --> 05:18:01,727
Very

1918
05:18:05,055 --> 05:18:07,871
Actually it's exactly the same

1919
05:18:08,127 --> 05:18:14,271
What is the news swanky way to multiply two vectors by

1920
05:18:16,063 --> 05:18:20,927

Look at the the at me and see if it's running the in Gemma or the alterna

1927

One of them one is H

1928
05:20:13,055 --> 05:20:16,895
There is

1931
05:20:28,159 --> 05:20:33,279
Exactly what you need to

1932
05:20:33,535 --> 05:20:34,559
Play

1933
05:20:52,735 --> 05:20:55,295

What happens now

1937
05:23:11,487 --> 05:23:17,631
Is it working for you

1938
05:23:17,887 --> 05:23:24,031
In the morning tomorrow you want in demo because you'll be reading indila

1939
05:23:37,087 --> 05:23:43,231
Say what

To be on Wi-Fi

1941
05:24:24,703 --> 05:24:30,847
That's really confusing

1942
05:24:32,895 --> 05:24:39,039
Actually it looks like it's poses

1943
05:24:39,295 --> 05:24:45,439
Exactly the right thing I don't know why the apply function have been wrong and I also don't know why

1944
05:24:45,695 --> 05:24:51,839
Someone into of watching the screen but it's definitely if I look at the numbers like right now

1945
05:24:52,095 --> 05:24:58,239
What's rooted very heavily towards on

1946
05:24:58,495 --> 05:25:04,639
2 + x -

1947
05:25:04,895 --> 05:25:05,919

Corner trainers x off which is confusing by

1950
05:25:25,376 --> 05:25:31,520
Looks like your further along now

1951
05:25:31,776 --> 05:25:37,920
What's the we can formalize an idea as to how these processes

1952
05:25:38,176 --> 05:25:42,016
What's the time

1953
05:25:42,272 --> 05:25:48,416

Tell me 43 people

Open interesting thing if he intended it was

1975
05:29:50,080 --> 05:29:56,224
So he's taking the Lighthouse quaternions

1976
05:29:56,480 --> 05:29:58,528
Positions

1977
05:29:58,784 --> 05:30:04,672
A20 does the Lighthouse calibrations for really are 3D space consideration the fact that

1978
05:30:06,976 --> 05:30:13,120
If that's how you position of lighthouses

1979
05:30:14,400 --> 05:30:20,544
You should probably just tried to compile with that and then so

2059
05:43:41,568 --> 05:43:44,640
Ok

2060
05:43:52,832 --> 05:43:57,952
Royal my hotspot from my phone

2061
05:44:03,072 --> 05:44:03,840
White

2062
05:44:07,168 --> 05:44:11,520
Lights on

2063
05:44:37,632 --> 05:44:41,728
And I really want

2064
05:44:54,016 --> 05:44:55,552
Pause

2065
05:45:09,376 --> 05:45:10,400
Hey Bella

2066
05:45:10,912 --> 05:45:12,448
If you stream

2067
05:45:12,960 --> 05:45:14,240
I want to see it

2068
05:45:14,496 --> 05:45:17,568
An artist if you want to see it

2069
05:45:18,592 --> 05:45:20,640
I I want to see

2070
05:45:21,152 --> 05:45:22,176
Ustream

2071
05:45:26,784 --> 05:45:27,808
That was confusing

2072
05:45:28,320 --> 05:45:29,344
Waterline

2073
05:45:29,600 --> 05:45:35,232
I want to see if he does it I want to see it.

2074
05:45:35,744 --> 05:45:41,888
And then let me know streaming

2075
05:45:42,144 --> 05:45:48,288
Get rid of everything else just rubbing off the internet kill it

2076
05:45:48,544 --> 05:45:50,848
Not both

2077
05:46:08,512 --> 05:46:11,840
All hoses

2078
05:46:12,608 --> 05:46:18,752
Give them a lighthouse at

2079
05:46:19,776 --> 05:46:24,640
Lighthouse

2080
05:46:26,688 --> 05:46:28,480
Disney Plus

2081
05:46:29,248 --> 05:46:34,624
Which 50A pose of 08001

2082
05:46:35,648 --> 05:46:36,416
1

2083
05:46:40,000 --> 05:46:41,280
Produce

2084
05:46:47,680 --> 05:46:48,448
Proper

2085
05:46:49,216 --> 05:46:53,312
Object stay for the

2086
05:46:53,568 --> 05:46:58,944
I like anybody who actually has a big in life survive I'm really hoping you would be right now

2087
05:46:59,200 --> 05:47:05,344
Make sure that we all agree on this so you guys can all read it

2088
05:47:05,600 --> 05:47:11,744
I really want it actually agree on this and if we can agree on it then things will be

2089
05:47:12,000 --> 05:47:13,792
I think very good

2090
05:47:14,048 --> 05:47:17,120
Specifically

2091
05:47:17,376 --> 05:47:23,520
Still around but if you are I am really hoping that that you can

2092
05:47:25,312 --> 05:47:27,360
Light mirror fires

2093
05:47:28,896 --> 05:47:32,992
And the same thing goes for albinos

2094
05:47:34,272 --> 05:47:37,856
Well I not remember your name and everything so

2095
05:47:39,648 --> 05:47:42,720
Still should be handled

2096
05:47:49,888 --> 05:47:52,448
Looking at your own picture of this

2097
05:47:54,496 --> 05:47:56,032
Hey Justin ok

2098
05:47:56,288 --> 05:47:59,360
Alarm to make sure that we agree on

2099
05:47:59,872 --> 05:48:02,688
On on the the definition of it

2100
05:48:04,480 --> 05:48:10,624
Proper AliExpress for the the object being tracked

2101
05:48:12,672 --> 05:48:18,816
The object being tracked

2102
05:48:19,072 --> 05:48:24,704
The Lighthouse it should be at

2103
05:48:26,752 --> 05:48:29,056
Bank of

2104
05:48:29,312 --> 05:48:31,616
Lighthouse Bude

2105
05:48:39,040 --> 05:48:41,600
So now you probably want to do is

2106
05:48:41,856 --> 05:48:48,000
Figure out which pins in the I squared as Potter in thing on map 2

2107
05:48:48,256 --> 05:48:51,840
The that you have that pot India

2108
05:48:52,608 --> 05:48:54,912
The pin number for

2109
05:48:56,704 --> 05:49:00,032
If you look in the Stream in

2110
05:49:02,336 --> 05:49:08,480
And so you find one that's like your 45 and 8019

2111
05:49:08,736 --> 05:49:09,504
I have plugged into

2112
05:49:11,552 --> 05:49:17,696
Should we be number 44 because the UK Open

2113
05:49:19,232 --> 05:49:23,328
Do you want to unplug the septum pierced

2114
05:49:23,584 --> 05:49:24,096
30

2115
05:49:25,376 --> 05:49:31,520
26-33 and verify that it actually goes love

2116
05:49:31,776 --> 05:49:36,896
Microlight

2117
05:49:40,736 --> 05:49:46,880
Ok so don't forget about that

2118
05:49:47,136 --> 05:49:53,280
My classes are spin defining zooplus to find Xbox as well

2119
05:49:54,304 --> 05:49:59,680
I mean it is right hand rule with all other map on far as I can tell

2120
05:50:05,312 --> 05:50:11,456
When is an interesting point out what are you defined as the rotation of the base station

2121
05:50:12,992 --> 05:50:16,320
People

2122
05:50:19,648 --> 05:50:21,184
I'm gonna go away

2123
05:50:23,488 --> 05:50:25,536
If it's on the ground

2124
05:50:25,792 --> 05:50:27,584
Nud passes up

2125
05:50:28,608 --> 05:50:29,888
Then

2126
05:50:31,424 --> 05:50:32,192
You

2127
05:50:32,448 --> 05:50:35,520
My middle finger is Big Boss

2128
05:50:37,824 --> 05:50:39,872
And I'm going to go with

2129
05:50:40,384 --> 05:50:42,432
This thing right here is white what

2130
05:50:42,944 --> 05:50:49,088
And that would be the direction from the lighthouses point of view it was sitting on a table with the run

2131
05:50:49,344 --> 05:50:50,624
Down

2132
05:50:56,256 --> 05:50:58,560
Ok hold on

2133
05:50:58,816 --> 05:51:04,960
Make light coloured flowers and you're taking and living room

2134
05:51:05,216 --> 05:51:11,360
Love my vibe

2135
05:51:11,616 --> 05:51:13,664
Ok

2136
05:51:14,176 --> 05:51:20,320
Take a white house right now in wall actually

2137
05:51:25,184 --> 05:51:26,976
Just write this first

2138
05:51:28,000 --> 05:51:28,768
Insured

2139
05:51:29,792 --> 05:51:32,352
Positioned

2140
05:51:32,608 --> 05:51:38,752
From the Lighthouse

2141
05:51:43,616 --> 05:51:45,152
Pause

2142
05:51:49,504 --> 05:51:51,808
Brown Brown

2143
05:51:54,880 --> 05:51:57,696
I upside down

2144
05:51:58,464 --> 05:52:01,536
Can I think that he is almost there

2145
05:52:01,792 --> 05:52:05,632
Arm note

2146
05:52:05,888 --> 05:52:08,448
Correct

2147
05:52:10,240 --> 05:52:11,520
Yes it does

2148
05:52:17,920 --> 05:52:22,272
Which is the original intention

2149
05:52:22,528 --> 05:52:25,344
What's the meaning of your own

2150
05:52:29,696 --> 05:52:35,840
Come on

2151
05:52:36,352 --> 05:52:42,496
Ok to do work at gravity vector coming from my house

2152
05:52:45,312 --> 05:52:49,408
Sorting out and see you new one

2153
05:52:50,944 --> 05:52:53,760
What's 9

2154
05:52:57,856 --> 05:53:01,184
Down

2155
05:53:01,952 --> 05:53:02,720
It 1

2156
05:53:02,976 --> 05:53:04,768
Play XYZ axis

2157
05:53:05,024 --> 05:53:06,048
Play Hopsin

2158
05:53:06,304 --> 05:53:08,352
Turn on the bedroom

2159
05:53:08,864 --> 05:53:12,960
We should probably match our location so it may offend me

2160
05:53:17,568 --> 05:53:18,080
Yeah

2161
05:53:20,384 --> 05:53:22,688
What

2162
05:53:22,944 --> 05:53:26,272
Ok before we write this

2163
05:53:26,784 --> 05:53:30,112
Oh is not finalised

2164
05:53:30,368 --> 05:53:36,512
Before we finalize it let's go find out with the gravity

2165
05:53:39,840 --> 05:53:42,400
Otx2 colour help us

2166
05:53:52,640 --> 05:53:58,528
Zelda xyz

2167
05:54:26,688 --> 05:54:32,832
What value is in using the acceleration data from the Lighthouse calibration

2168
05:54:33,344 --> 05:54:39,232
We would definitely want to be using all of the devices that were calibrated by and you information

2169
05:54:40,000 --> 05:54:44,864
Another thing to maybe helpline

2170
05:54:56,640 --> 05:55:00,992
Is running right now

2171
05:55:02,528 --> 05:55:05,600
Calibrate

2172
05:55:16,352 --> 05:55:18,400
That makes no sense

2173
05:55:23,008 --> 05:55:25,056
We're definitely getting something wrong

2174
05:55:41,184 --> 05:55:45,792
Can you give me a second

2175
05:55:46,048 --> 05:55:50,400
I'm going to a mountain lighthouse now and we will see

2176
05:55:50,912 --> 05:55:54,752
What's actually going on

2177
05:55:55,264 --> 05:56:01,408
Ok so now you know you can read the data from this point

2178
05:56:01,664 --> 05:56:04,992
You could do something like a plus

2179
05:56:05,760 --> 05:56:11,904
If you go into the code for the iceberg

2180
05:56:13,696 --> 05:56:19,840
Scroll way down the bottom down here there is an is10 isr

2181
05:56:20,096 --> 05:56:26,240
Is currently reading but there is a way I can

2182
05:56:26,496 --> 05:56:27,008
More soon

2183
05:56:27,264 --> 05:56:30,080
Through the buffers

2184
05:56:30,336 --> 05:56:36,480
On be able to tell me through the day

2185
05:56:36,736 --> 05:56:42,880
All whenever completed and then you can go red like stuff through the data

2186
05:56:43,136 --> 05:56:49,280
11 the time and you can keep a current account

2187
05:56:49,792 --> 05:56:54,912
And then the left and this time that

2188
05:56:55,168 --> 05:57:01,312
And then the next train is low again or something you know that time it went well

2189
05:57:01,568 --> 05:57:06,432
That's seems like a place and then you can use that to monitor

2190
05:57:07,712 --> 05:57:13,856
Like events coming from the things or something like that

2191
05:57:16,416 --> 05:57:22,560
Right now you could probably just

2192
05:57:22,816 --> 05:57:28,960
What have it have a thing in there like a counter where the first thing it's called you know it's on the Buffer and the next

2193
05:57:29,216 --> 05:57:35,360
It's called you know it's on the first offer 10101

2194
05:57:35,616 --> 05:57:40,992
Get cold

2195
05:57:41,248 --> 05:57:44,576
Every single time on the airport

2196
05:57:44,832 --> 05:57:50,976
The buffer is full you can operate on that data

2197
05:57:51,232 --> 05:57:57,376
Which is what we put out the Darwin

2198
05:57:57,888 --> 05:58:04,032
The first time that function gets called by the hardware

2199
05:58:04,288 --> 05:58:10,432
After the first time you can look at the first and all the date in the first bus

2200
05:58:10,688 --> 05:58:16,832
The next time I called you gonna get through the day in the 2nd

2201
05:58:17,088 --> 05:58:19,904
In the second bathroom in the second half

2202
05:58:20,160 --> 05:58:23,232
That will probably work

2203
05:58:25,024 --> 05:58:26,560
Movinga

2204
05:58:27,328 --> 05:58:28,864
Ok

2205
05:58:42,432 --> 05:58:48,576
Ok

2206
05:58:55,232 --> 05:59:01,376
Which was

2207
05:59:01,632 --> 05:59:07,776
Really

2208
05:59:08,032 --> 05:59:14,176
Today's daylight saving

2209
05:59:20,832 --> 05:59:26,976
People probably dead now

2210
05:59:27,232 --> 05:59:33,376
The first day of autumn

2211
05:59:33,632 --> 05:59:37,728
Exterior lights on

2212
05:59:39,008 --> 05:59:41,568
I'm running at the deadline tomorrow morning

2213
05:59:47,968 --> 05:59:54,112
On the timer

2214
06:00:01,280 --> 06:00:03,072
Anymore

2215
06:00:15,616 --> 06:00:21,760
Cancel the picture

2216
06:00:22,016 --> 06:00:28,160
Tip top the

2217
06:00:28,416 --> 06:00:34,560
Hi Alicia t32 fingers a little painful but I'm sure that once you start actually getting data

2218
06:00:34,816 --> 06:00:36,864
It's going to be a lot easier

2219
06:00:37,376 --> 06:00:43,520
Like what you can start passing through at 10

2220
06:00:43,776 --> 06:00:49,920
Stream absolute

2221
06:00:50,176 --> 06:00:56,320
Gloria definitely

2222
06:00:56,576 --> 06:01:00,928
Completely useless to try to tell what the actual angles are

2223
06:01:01,440 --> 06:01:06,048
But it doesn't look like he used to think frame because

2224
06:01:06,304 --> 06:01:08,096
When it's like that

2225
06:01:08,352 --> 06:01:13,728
Like straight up and down the Y component is positive

2226
06:01:14,752 --> 06:01:16,800
Please

2227
06:01:17,824 --> 06:01:21,408
Negative

2228
06:01:38,560 --> 06:01:44,704
From green point of view

2229
06:01:47,008 --> 06:01:53,152
Please tell me how is brain works

2230
06:01:58,272 --> 06:02:02,368
That's really cool if we all just buy happened to Belmont

2231
06:02:03,392 --> 06:02:05,696
Off

2232
06:02:06,208 --> 06:02:12,352
On the tractor

2233
06:02:12,608 --> 06:02:18,752
Always possible so

2234
06:02:19,008 --> 06:02:25,152
Producing negative 39

2235
06:02:25,408 --> 06:02:31,552
Thank goodness

2236
06:02:31,808 --> 06:02:37,952
Hey like I'm free

2237
06:02:38,208 --> 06:02:44,352
Stop

2238
06:02:57,408 --> 06:03:03,552
No giving him

2239
06:03:10,208 --> 06:03:16,352
All the crumbs

2240
06:03:16,608 --> 06:03:22,752
I can

2241
06:03:29,408 --> 06:03:35,552
The down so from

2242
06:03:35,808 --> 06:03:41,952
Point of view it would be best if this was negative

2243
06:03:42,208 --> 06:03:48,352
What is the

2244
06:03:48,608 --> 06:03:54,752
Set the gravity vector

2245
06:03:56,032 --> 06:04:01,408
The down

2246
06:04:02,688 --> 06:04:08,832
Moonlight the up vector from the lighthouses forward vector from the Lighthouse in point

2247
06:04:12,672 --> 06:04:18,816
You know what

2248
06:04:19,072 --> 06:04:25,216
This is how I imagine it

2249
06:04:25,472 --> 06:04:30,336
Setting up on it staying there

2250
06:04:36,224 --> 06:04:39,808
This is a very large negative number right now

2251
06:04:40,832 --> 06:04:41,344
Time

2252
06:04:45,696 --> 06:04:51,840
Outward 11 towards

2253
06:04:52,096 --> 06:04:58,240
This is looking at the Lighthouse

2254
06:04:58,496 --> 06:05:04,640
A receiver for the white house now to go

2255
06:05:04,896 --> 06:05:10,016
Where is

2256
06:05:10,272 --> 06:05:16,416
It says -3

2257
06:05:16,672 --> 06:05:22,816
Pause wine over 47c

2258
06:05:23,072 --> 06:05:27,168
Play the devil

2259
06:05:27,424 --> 06:05:33,568
Porridge

2260
06:05:37,408 --> 06:05:43,552
I'm going in the sea answer just 10 minutes

2261
06:05:52,000 --> 06:05:58,144
I'm so confused again

2262
06:05:58,400 --> 06:06:04,544
I'm the 18 years receiving data from the Lighthouse it is not caring about

2263
06:06:04,800 --> 06:06:08,128
Play acting as a dumb receiver

2264
06:06:15,808 --> 06:06:21,952
I think I earn more than friends

2265
06:06:22,208 --> 06:06:25,536
Common

2266
06:06:26,048 --> 06:06:26,560
Hello

2267
06:06:29,888 --> 06:06:35,008
So much

2268
06:06:36,032 --> 06:06:42,176
Entertainment for real

2269
06:06:47,808 --> 06:06:51,136
Oh you know what it was updating and I was holding it

2270
06:06:51,392 --> 06:06:54,976
Turn the vibration was problem with it

2271
06:07:06,240 --> 06:07:10,592
Music

2272
06:07:11,360 --> 06:07:14,944
Can we can we act like

2273
06:07:19,040 --> 06:07:24,160
Away ok so it's measuring e-force against gravity I didn't see that one before

2274
06:07:31,584 --> 06:07:33,632
If it's unfortunate gravity

2275
06:07:35,680 --> 06:07:39,008
Wanted to be positive Z in my world

2276
06:07:39,520 --> 06:07:40,288
Would be up

2277
06:07:41,568 --> 06:07:43,616
It was an inspector pointing up

2278
06:07:56,928 --> 06:08:01,792
Yes that's what I'm hoping

2279
06:08:02,048 --> 06:08:08,192
Objects moving away from the Lighthouse positives and negatives

2280
06:08:08,448 --> 06:08:09,728
Link invention the figure out

2281
06:08:10,752 --> 06:08:13,824
My inclination would be the same as positives

2282
06:08:16,384 --> 06:08:21,248
No it's not no she's just gone

2283
06:08:36,096 --> 06:08:39,936
In the Liver again

2284
06:08:40,192 --> 06:08:43,264
Coming out music

2285
06:08:43,520 --> 06:08:48,128
I'm ok with this what's this

2286
06:08:48,640 --> 06:08:52,480
Does seem fair or whatever

2287
06:08:55,552 --> 06:08:59,904
Ok ru

2288
06:09:04,512 --> 06:09:10,656
No when the Lighthouse is

2289
06:09:10,912 --> 06:09:17,056
Condition

2290
06:09:17,312 --> 06:09:23,456
I'm ok with that

2291
06:09:23,712 --> 06:09:28,832
Set the right hand rule works and you can't read it like that the Cartesian plane

2292
06:09:29,088 --> 06:09:32,160
Like the angels make sense in X and Y

2293
06:09:33,952 --> 06:09:34,976
Ok

2294
06:09:35,232 --> 06:09:36,000
How are you

2295
06:09:39,072 --> 06:09:40,352
Light on

2296
06:09:40,608 --> 06:09:46,752
Who to talk to

2297
06:09:47,264 --> 06:09:48,288
Alarm

2298
06:09:49,056 --> 06:09:54,432
Hey no I'm talking to you

2299
06:10:26,176 --> 06:10:30,784
A lot easier to draw

2300
06:10:31,040 --> 06:10:34,368
Return pass Texas backwards from taxes

2301
06:10:34,624 --> 06:10:38,208
The Lighthouse

2302
06:10:38,464 --> 06:10:44,352
Then things start to make alarm set

2303
06:10:51,008 --> 06:10:55,104
Ok

2304
06:10:55,360 --> 06:11:01,504
I see no reason not to use this I think about that I do like it it's a bit weird

2305
06:11:01,760 --> 06:11:06,880
Because I wish I was a white house on my back in for telling the plus that put the

2306
06:11:07,136 --> 06:11:07,904
Up

2307
06:11:09,440 --> 06:11:11,488
Yeah that does kind of mess with

2308
06:11:12,768 --> 06:11:13,792
Lights off

2309
06:11:20,192 --> 06:11:26,336
Because I be worried about posting a publicly in

2310
06:11:26,592 --> 06:11:32,736
Github repository

2311
06:11:32,992 --> 06:11:34,016
The picture right here

2312
06:11:37,088 --> 06:11:39,136
How do I

2313
06:11:49,376 --> 06:11:52,192
Forgotten how to actually

2314
06:12:10,368 --> 06:12:16,512
Looks like the cloud

2315
06:12:19,072 --> 06:12:20,608
Useful

2316
06:12:25,984 --> 06:12:29,568
You should have another space to most of the Rose

2317
06:12:32,128 --> 06:12:34,944
Turn the lights off

2318
06:12:43,392 --> 06:12:48,000
Can you just do that done

2319
06:12:49,536 --> 06:12:52,352
Lighthouse

2320
06:12:52,608 --> 06:12:55,168
Pause

2321
06:12:56,192 --> 06:12:59,008
ATG

2322
06:12:59,520 --> 06:13:00,800
Ok

2323
06:13:06,432 --> 06:13:12,576
Cavity base playing recording and all of Leon 1p alfa-2b roughly

2324
06:13:14,368 --> 06:13:20,512
Recording

2325
06:13:20,768 --> 06:13:24,096
Emotion in Motion

2326
06:13:24,352 --> 06:13:25,376
And then stop

2327
06:13:26,144 --> 06:13:32,288
In motion and stop doing that

2328
06:13:32,544 --> 06:13:38,688
Because we will also give us a like that we can work again

2329
06:13:38,944 --> 06:13:41,760
Final affected by

2330
06:13:42,016 --> 06:13:46,112
That would be really nice

2331
06:13:46,624 --> 06:13:48,416
Emotions

2332
06:13:48,928 --> 06:13:52,512
Valentines by Carol giant

2333
06:13:52,768 --> 06:13:57,120
Skip

2334
06:14:00,960 --> 06:14:07,104
We will have something that wall at least verify that our stuff is not stupid

2335
06:14:10,688 --> 06:14:14,784
I want to do this and the

2336
06:14:18,112 --> 06:14:21,184
And the

2337
06:14:21,440 --> 06:14:22,720
Turn up volume

2338
06:14:43,200 --> 06:14:49,088
Free camera system

2339
06:14:53,440 --> 06:14:59,584
Ok I would imagine the matter what I was going to brutally crushed

2340
06:14:59,840 --> 06:15:04,448
Concerned I could believe it

2341
06:15:08,032 --> 06:15:12,896
Excuses

2342
06:15:18,784 --> 06:15:21,344
So what you're saying is we are forced to trust you

2343
06:15:32,864 --> 06:15:39,008
Are you waiting on Mark take you back on

2344
06:15:39,264 --> 06:15:42,080
I'm sorry I didn't know that

2345
06:15:43,360 --> 06:15:44,128
I love you

2346
06:15:44,384 --> 06:15:46,688
We will probably try and we'll all different

2347
06:15:51,040 --> 06:15:54,368
General

2348
06:15:59,232 --> 06:16:05,376
Respectively

2349
06:16:05,632 --> 06:16:11,776
The second is the rotation good for good there I think

2350
06:16:12,032 --> 06:16:13,056
Livery on Now 1

2351
06:16:13,312 --> 06:16:19,456
And then the second one is open or should be sure

2352
06:16:19,712 --> 06:16:23,552
With the front of the Lighthouse

2353
06:16:24,064 --> 06:16:25,856
Looks like music

2354
06:16:28,672 --> 06:16:34,816
Ok

2355
06:16:35,072 --> 06:16:39,168
I hope we can work on this

2356
06:16:45,824 --> 06:16:51,968
Lights on

2357
06:16:58,624 --> 06:17:04,768
Rmkv Ladbrokes enjoy your

2358
06:17:08,864 --> 06:17:10,656
Lights off

2359
06:17:10,912 --> 06:17:14,240
Yes you're welcome

2360
06:17:15,008 --> 06:17:21,152
Ok so I am going to take

2361
06:17:26,016 --> 06:17:32,160
The is not universal indicator using

2362
06:17:32,416 --> 06:17:38,560
Pause for all situations where he is

2363
06:17:38,816 --> 06:17:42,400
News

2364
06:17:42,656 --> 06:17:46,240
Turn off

2365
06:17:46,496 --> 06:17:51,360
Stop playing around 8 or 87

2366
06:17:55,712 --> 06:18:01,344
3000 lying on its back

2367
06:18:05,184 --> 06:18:09,024
The Lighthouse

2368
06:18:11,072 --> 06:18:13,120
Zerozerozero

2369
06:18:13,632 --> 06:18:15,936
Lying on its back

2370
06:18:19,520 --> 06:18:21,568
Turn off word

2371
06:18:30,016 --> 06:18:36,160
Actor from the amateur

2372
06:18:43,584 --> 06:18:49,728
0 positive 55 right

2373
06:19:22,240 --> 06:19:23,264
Incurred

2374
06:19:28,128 --> 06:19:30,688
Get tricky

2375
06:19:30,944 --> 06:19:32,736
How can I get this park ride

2376
06:19:38,880 --> 06:19:42,464
Maybe we should we should have the Lighthouse

2377
06:19:50,656 --> 06:19:56,800
Have the definition with his right here

2378
06:20:04,992 --> 06:20:07,296
The Lighthouse is

2379
06:20:14,464 --> 06:20:16,768
Lighthouse 5

2380
06:20:22,656 --> 06:20:27,776
Differently later

2381
06:20:28,032 --> 06:20:34,176
A brown owl

2382
06:20:34,432 --> 06:20:39,296
My house

2383
06:20:48,256 --> 06:20:51,072
The Lighthouse

2384
06:20:53,888 --> 06:20:58,752
Lighthouse

2385
06:21:16,928 --> 06:21:19,744
Yes it would be you're right it would be

2386
06:21:27,168 --> 06:21:29,216
Will reviews

2387
06:21:30,240 --> 06:21:32,288
Close of

2388
06:21:33,568 --> 06:21:35,872
Euro 0 of 1

2389
06:21:37,664 --> 06:21:41,248
1000

2390
06:21:41,504 --> 06:21:42,784
Think that's correct

2391
06:21:56,096 --> 06:22:01,216
Although no this is wrong

2392
06:22:02,496 --> 06:22:08,640
Are we finding the post of the eye

2393
06:22:08,896 --> 06:22:14,272
At some point too

2394
06:22:18,112 --> 06:22:20,672
I do want a rotation because

2395
06:22:21,696 --> 06:22:25,280
What ar no carrier will be

2396
06:22:25,792 --> 06:22:28,864
Oh actually no

2397
06:22:29,888 --> 06:22:31,936
Do that

2398
06:22:32,192 --> 06:22:36,544
Friday

2399
06:22:36,800 --> 06:22:42,944
This way back to the same

2400
06:22:46,528 --> 06:22:50,880
Union to B18 5JS

2401
06:23:03,936 --> 06:23:10,080
Hey Kirby or somebody can you do the same sort of thing with the tape and with you or

2402
06:23:10,336 --> 06:23:16,480
Based on the imu cos I'm starting to think that the proposed

2403
06:23:16,736 --> 06:23:17,760
Sing is wrong

2404
06:23:18,272 --> 06:23:22,880
Pose with Michael definition for what way is up and down in in everything on

2405
06:23:46,944 --> 06:23:50,784
Which I believe I did

2406
06:24:08,192 --> 06:24:13,568
I know I don't know

2407
06:24:22,528 --> 06:24:26,112
I know is that issue

2408
06:24:30,976 --> 06:24:37,120
Refrigerate here

2409
06:24:41,472 --> 06:24:44,032
That might be the problems work

2410
06:25:29,088 --> 06:25:29,600
Yes

2411
06:25:29,856 --> 06:25:31,904
I agree we are right handed

2412
06:25:47,520 --> 06:25:53,664
Do you know the copyright status closed on that like that would be awesome

2413
06:26:34,368 --> 06:26:38,208
I do not run looking at know what I'm looking at now bye no friends

2414
06:26:52,544 --> 06:26:56,896

2415
06:26:58,432 --> 06:27:00,736
Hornet

2416
06:27:00,992 --> 06:27:04,576
Local to the hmd

2417
06:27:05,344 --> 06:27:06,880
And then

2418
06:27:07,136 --> 06:27:08,160
News

2419
06:27:15,840 --> 06:27:21,984
Transformed point to WorldPay from the

2420
06:27:22,240 --> 06:27:23,520
Lighthouses

2421
06:27:23,776 --> 06:27:25,568
Light of the

2422
06:27:26,080 --> 06:27:30,688
I think we all agree that is the direction it should be that light

2423
06:27:30,944 --> 06:27:34,784
The poser should give you the position of the object

2424
06:27:35,040 --> 06:27:41,184
From the Lighthouse is point of view

2425
06:27:41,440 --> 06:27:47,328
Is when you're doing the calibration

2426
06:28:11,392 --> 06:28:12,672
BST data structure

2427
06:28:35,456 --> 06:28:40,064
Seriously only Northern line

2428
06:30:47,040 --> 06:30:52,416
Really healthy at the base station opposes elsewhere I think go away

2429
06:30:55,488 --> 06:30:57,536
From LA pose

2430
06:31:13,152 --> 06:31:16,224
Old is complaining to be a 30 card

2431
06:31:34,656 --> 06:31:35,424
Ok

2432
06:31:36,448 --> 06:31:41,568
Actually that's a good question and not remember where is the Lighthouse

2433
06:31:41,824 --> 06:31:43,104
Pause it

2434
06:31:47,456 --> 06:31:48,992
Play Spotify

2435
06:31:51,040 --> 06:31:54,112
Rape videos

2436
06:32:28,160 --> 06:32:34,304
The poser should use the same flight out closes when calculator

2437
06:32:34,560 --> 06:32:40,704
There's no question about that kind of the definition for the internal operation

2438
06:32:40,960 --> 06:32:46,848
And like the intermediate like when you get a lighthouse poem

2439
06:32:53,248 --> 06:32:59,392
Suppose of the hosts of the

2440
06:33:09,376 --> 06:33:12,192
WorldPay

2441
06:33:13,472 --> 06:33:15,264
For our example

2442
06:33:15,520 --> 06:33:19,872
The Lighthouse is a 000

2443
06:33:20,384 --> 06:33:26,016
Practicality Lighthouse

2444
06:33:26,784 --> 06:33:32,928
Other side

2445
06:33:44,704 --> 06:33:50,848
By applying the output of the

2446
06:34:01,088 --> 06:34:06,208
Ok when we read everybody agree about that

2447
06:34:42,048 --> 06:34:48,192
Ok I wish you have an HND that you can

2448
06:35:13,024 --> 06:35:16,608
I'm just checking all everybody doesn't agree with

2449
06:35:17,120 --> 06:35:20,192
Is your should always be returning the

2450
06:35:20,448 --> 06:35:24,800
Listen or pose of the object that they're tracking

2451
06:35:25,312 --> 06:35:28,896
And weather in my ideas when you first RL

2452
06:35:29,152 --> 06:35:32,480
And then you say 1000

2453
06:35:33,248 --> 06:35:39,392
And then you apply everything and it would be giving you the effectively and lighthouse based at

2454
06:35:41,440 --> 06:35:42,720
Everybody agree there

2455
06:35:59,616 --> 06:36:02,176
What is the patient data

2456
06:36:05,760 --> 06:36:06,784
How's

2457
06:36:18,560 --> 06:36:21,888
Off

2458
06:36:22,144 --> 06:36:24,704
Ok stream houses provide pose

2459
06:36:25,216 --> 06:36:28,288
I'm ok so now we need to define

2460
06:36:30,080 --> 06:36:31,872
Read sorry

2461
06:36:32,128 --> 06:36:38,272
Defining the value of pose in

2462
06:36:45,952 --> 06:36:48,000
PlayStation data

2463
06:37:05,920 --> 06:37:08,224
I'm incline to 1

2464
06:37:08,480 --> 06:37:14,624
Nothing else tonight

2465
06:37:16,928 --> 06:37:18,720
I think will be good for tonight

2466
06:37:19,232 --> 06:37:21,024
How far along are you

2467
06:37:23,328 --> 06:37:26,912
Stop

2468
06:37:27,680 --> 06:37:30,496
Constance Oldham

2469
06:37:32,288 --> 06:37:34,080
Does Netflix use data on mobile

2470

Emedia wing mirror device

2471
06:37:39,712 --> 06:37:43,296
I am now

2472
06:37:43,808 --> 06:37:48,416
A hard-wearing in userspace but spotting is Lidl's Connell

2473
06:37:49,696 --> 06:37:55,840
So I think

2474
06:37:56,096 --> 06:37:59,936
Pause James

2475
06:38:03,008 --> 06:38:07,616
OK Google find the value of clothes in Beeston

2476
06:38:08,128 --> 06:38:11,968
What are the pros and cons of defining this pose

2477
06:38:13,248 --> 06:38:19,392
The White House's position in world space and its rotation

2478
06:38:19,648 --> 06:38:22,208
As a conversion between

2479
06:38:23,744 --> 06:38:29,376
The you take a point on the Lighthouse inside lighthouse based and you apply the pose

2480
06:38:29,632 --> 06:38:32,704
Gives you a position in world space

2481
06:38:39,616 --> 06:38:41,664
Will convert

2482
06:38:42,176 --> 06:38:47,040
Bang Whitehouse local space

2483
06:38:47,296 --> 06:38:52,160
Volume 28 position in world day

2484
06:38:52,416 --> 06:38:58,560
Calibrating

2485
06:38:58,816 --> 06:39:01,632
You have an armchair

2486
06:39:01,888 --> 06:39:07,008
Define 000

2487
06:39:10,592 --> 06:39:13,152
You will need to

2488
06:39:13,408 --> 06:39:16,480
Hey good home and invert

2489
06:39:30,560 --> 06:39:32,608

Take into counterpose of lighthouses

2497
06:40:36,352 --> 06:40:42,496
Operation and return of object

2498
06:40:42,752 --> 06:40:47,360
The lighthouses

2499
06:40:49,408 --> 06:40:50,944

2500
06:40:59,392 --> 06:41:03,232

Without by our friendship there

2502
06:41:05,792 --> 06:41:09,376
It's a little bit too really gather it but I'm pretty sure that is the same

2503
06:41:22,176 --> 06:41:26,016
So that would actually Media case I think we agree on it all now

2504
06:41:28,320 --> 06:41:32,672

Ok Toby and everywhere I'm going to go this into the discord chat

2506
06:42:44,608 --> 06:42:46,400
And then we can

2507
06:42:46,656 --> 06:42:52,800
Verify that we agree on all seasons on

It's 145

2516
06:46:47,808 --> 06:46:53,952

Believe that the only

2538
06:48:50,176 --> 06:48:56,320
More work and most people who want this

2539
06:48:56,576 --> 06:49:00,160
Not to use it with x

2540
06:49:00,928 --> 06:49:07,072
And there is no problem with using it with no negative consequences

Back light wood bathroom from FM

2618
06:58:33,600 --> 06:58:35,904
Especially if we have

2619
06:58:36,160 --> 06:58:38,208
You could take your arm thing

2620
06:58:38,464 --> 06:58:42,048
And move the object for lighthouses point of view

2621
06:58:42,304 --> 06:58:48,448

Painful

2633
07:01:24,864 --> 07:01:30,240
I am inclined to believe that the modules will not be produced outside fly

Light a year ago they said oh yeah it's going to be the next time

2665
07:05:34,720 --> 07:05:40,864
A later and there is literally nothing done that has gotten any closer to this

2708
07:11:37,216 --> 07:11:38,752

07:25:53,024 --> 07:25:57,376
So can take in light

2803
07:25:57,888 --> 07:25:59,424
Request stop

2804
07:26:00,192 --> 07:26:03,776
And some point that into

2805
07:26:04,800 --> 07:26:08,896
So I have a server

2806
07:26:09,408 --> 07:26:11,200
Call out to

2807
07:26:11,456 --> 07:26:12,480
Harding

2808
07:26:12,992 --> 07:26:16,832
That leads to

2809
07:26:17,600 --> 07:26:19,648
Half directly to a server

2810
07:26:20,416 --> 07:26:22,464
Punching

2811
07:26:25,792 --> 07:26:29,376
Eventually let it manage confirm

2812
07:26:33,984 --> 07:26:40,128
I find it surprising that there are this many people on the planet who actually understands enough

2813
07:26:45,504 --> 07:26:50,880
Everything

2814
07:26:54,976 --> 07:27:01,120
I don't see any

2815
07:27:01,376 --> 07:27:07,520
Anything like that

2816
07:27:09,056 --> 07:27:12,384
It looks like it is using me

2817
07:27:13,920 --> 07:27:16,480
Like that

2818
07:27:31,328 --> 07:27:33,120

2819
07:28:23,808 --> 07:28:28,672

2820
07:28:34,560 --> 07:28:40,704
Oh you know like me there using hardware

2821
07:28:44,032 --> 07:28:50,176

2823
07:29:00,928 --> 07:29:02,208

2824
07:29:03,744 --> 07:29:05,024

2827
07:29:25,504 --> 07:29:27,040
I guess I can make it

2828
07:29:29,600 --> 07:29:34,208
Public live streams I don't know if I really want to

2829
07:29:34,464 --> 07:29:37,280
Because we didn't really accomplish all that much

2830
07:29:40,096 --> 07:29:46,240
If you open chat like watching do you would you want us to make

2831
07:29:46,496 --> 07:29:49,312
Or is it not really

2832
07:30:17,216 --> 07:30:23,360

2833
07:30:33,600 --> 07:30:37,184
Turn on Sam's light on

07:30:44,864 --> 07:30:51,008

2837
07:31:04,064 --> 07:31:10,208

2846
07:32:21,376 --> 07:32:24,192
