1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Just getting things ready I found a bug

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Turn my thinking it was just I had built the 1400 different user identifier bottom experimental

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Turn off

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey ok this is part 2 I guess of live stream

5
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Number 9 really important one I designed

6
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Built some of these forests if I can get it to focus here

7
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Earlier I got a 2

8
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Boards and got them printed and populated and now were going to see if we can flash

9
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Wilson firmware and see what some easy analogue signals look like if I have any hope which I probably don't

10
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Being able to see what the signal coming off light houses look like on

11
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Honestly I think I'll be what he just to get the thing to the sympathise next with voltage real tonight but

12
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Let's just started and see where we end up going to plug these in

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Power and all that that one ground

14
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Brand new

15
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Rebooting while they like I did before but that's to be expected

16
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Reset it here and I should

17
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Harm

18
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
Eircom

19
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
Ok

20
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
Irish to English is right now I think it's fine

21
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Pair

22
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
Move it

23
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Belgrade

24
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
So maybe I was wrong there is something else going on that would be really disappointing

25
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
I would feel really embarrassed if if this is a boss again

26
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
I just programmed one it just worked

27
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
Am I doing wrong

28
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
And I hopefully get moving shortly here trying to figure out what is going on

29
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
I've actually never had this problem

30
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
Just my family that works

31
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Play actually be a hardware problem or something maybe

32
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
Crowned

33
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Broken in something is wrong with this one

34
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:04,799
What is going on here

35
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
Between some plans to check between that and what should be 3 v it looks like

36
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
All the places 30 should be matter

37
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
Really matter

38
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
How to check the rear 0 volts should be on gpio 15 which it is

39
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
3.3 that's weird that's gpio to analyse

40
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
That's fair actually no I could do

41
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
I try shooting

42
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Donedeal

43
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
Effective

44
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,647
The same bored what I was going on

45
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Yeah I'm actually I just never seen this problem before and

46
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
Yeah yeah

47
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
Use the A66 you know you figure it if it was a prob

48
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
That I wouldn't recognise it from you know song something they like every time that happened with that

49
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Listen wrong there's always problems in the world

50
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
Find another board

51
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Try this one

52
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
Definitely

53
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Sing is definitely harder really ok I guess it's time to start busting out something that the bug this

54
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Unusual things and doing I don't normally set it up this way of gpio

55
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
Arm wired up this way but it shouldn't be a problem

56
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
Virgin on my famous last words but you know

57
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
Nasty pio2 there

58
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:31,039
No hun

59
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
The other thing I can do is

60
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
Have any starter and short out gpio 15 sometime

61
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Have that shorted

62
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,687
Passata

63
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
Nothing

64
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
What weird

65
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
Ok I'll do that then

66
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Actually as it is it isn't changing anything this before it you know should

67
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Do that

68
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
Call Kirsten

69
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
Backwoods

70
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
Stop

71
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
It looks like it's just the wrong boot mode

72
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Doesn't make any sense

73
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
Vegetable shortening

74
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
Country Roads

75
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
A

76
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
I bet he never burn his lips

77
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
Yeah I do have

78
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
Get me anymore

79
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
Are used for cameos

80
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
Repository

81
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
Somewhere I have the

82
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Turn on my laptop

83
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
Telling me stuff ok what is it telling me

84
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
Interesting

85
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,847
Thank you for telling me the search that as it turns out the

86
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
This is a really good point dry scalp feature is differently on the

87
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
Hardware

88
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
Reset different ok maybe actually part of

89
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,447
2xx

90
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:53,247
No I do it over at

91
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
On 27th

92
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
Ok where is this used

93
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
Tried it

94
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,303
Ok

95
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
So I shouldn't probably do is

96
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
Fnbr

97
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
Yes actually

98
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
And yes

99
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Think I just can't believe this I just loading

100
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
Yeah riding the new Den so it may or may not just work it just work

101
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
Play Paul thank you for that that was a really good point I really should have just tried to see what it was

102
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
Tell me normally I'm just too lazy to execute the 1 commandments which is the Barbary to the Buddha portrait of 74

103
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Ok now we can ask to go do something

104
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
Until I'm going to add a user

105
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
Are you to remain that say and in here I am going to

106
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,207
Enable the isporter subsystem

107
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,791
Cos that seems like an important thing to half

108
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,191
Then I think what I'm going to do is build some sort of state machine

109
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
Handles from the inner up

110
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
Hear what I can do I can edit the on

111
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,623
That is to do my bidding basically

112
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,559
I'm here for now comment all this out

113
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
Hand on piano

114
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:30,591
Turn on stat = 0

115
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Something on my clarinet

116
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
I'm going to want to do something in

117
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
A 2TB hard pumpkins

118
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,863
What is r

119
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,615
TPI 13 gpio14

120
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
Over and look at someone to accept

121
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
What number was he did with that basically huge

122
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,816
Anything is anymore

123
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
Add see hear gpio

124
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,568
Complicated

125
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
Yeah that way

126
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
12 13 14 12 13 14

127
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,000
How to start work

128
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:02,496
And a news Iman when I do is configure

129
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
Beyond configure the

130
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
Better way of doing this like the new way but I completely

131
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,632
Anyway once this is configured or something maybe

132
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
I can learn go and in here changed mother's life and close this tab

133
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,456
I'm so under is teacher include

134
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Sexy till

135
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:23,904
Out what I can do

136
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
I can specify

137
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
Or = BD13 or BD14

138
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
And that will enable the output

139
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:45,408
I'm sorry for you

140
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,248
I can search the output

141
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,144
I think it does should drive the two cans high

142
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
Exit 1st of May through the two pence well

143
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
And then we'll drive and high so here

144
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,896
This plan is very high

145
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
It's not very high why is that pin so high

146
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
Songs

147
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
Nothing on there septic pasta

148
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
That's weird

149
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,800
Please

150
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Ok 323 and

151
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,720
163 that's not right

152
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
Here

153
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,784
Somewhere there is a gpio just work

154
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:33,440
I thought of a problem though that might might be an issue I don't know if the ice cream last boss

155
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
If you remap the pins to be

156
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:42,400
Gpio that can't be gpio so that that could be a problem

157
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
Gonna have to take a load of that

158
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Right now

159
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:24,896
Thank you maybe I should just

160
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:31,296
Stop

161
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,696
2 12 13 14 to 12

162
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:44,096
TPI 13 x 14

163
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:25,824
Play

164
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,456
Oh well

165
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,752
Sharpies pens

166
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
See 3.3 V and IC

167
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
Rewind 3 v also make sure that they are up to still firing

168
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
Update still firing

169
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
I'm so now what I can do is I can then some outside

170
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Setting up clear

171
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
And what I can do

172
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Is inside of this code right here which is being executed just continuously non-stop I can use

173
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Beyond bank

174
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
It's supposed to go -5 to 5-year

175
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Play gonna get there but we actually get so so charge

176
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,176
To the signals have to go one off to on off one off to on after 1-hour

177
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
22 off

178
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:16,160
I think that's what's the try Paternoster what happens so switch

179
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
I'm totally hotspot

180
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
Would be both of them off so came out clear

181
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:37,152
It's 1234

182
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,952
14 + 13

183
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
Can I clear them again in that the other one

184
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
Turn the lights on

185
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
Charge pump 20

186
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:28,352
Poole Quay

187
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:34,752
What happens

188
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:41,152
CW on timers on the ESP

189
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:47,552
We are not a normal thing so

190
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
It's just not a friendly

191
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
Even though the actual system is normally nowadays the used the firmware

192
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:13,152
Are they don't even use the real one that's like coming directly from a sweater

193
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
Is jerk esp32 now that's got a ton of real every like

194
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
TV Lands and all of that

195
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
Clear cd13

196
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,752
Search

197
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
23.3

198
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
And that's super lame

199
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
Play 5 volts

200
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,752
What's try different what happens if I turn one on

201
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:17,152
Hot train

202
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,552
Set 13 set

203
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
14

204
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
Queer 13

205
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
Getting now

206
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
Still pretty bad

207
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
The circus doing something

208
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
Uploaded maybe I should be working on this yet

209
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
I'll go spend 5-minutes and do that right now

210
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,952
56 Whitehouse

211
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:31,552
Open

212
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
That's such a let down the charge

213
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
That Lane

214
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
Just have a bigger photograph that I expected

215
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:29,152
Forgotten how to initialise

216
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,952
He has an example in here somewhere

217
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:39,040
Charge pump failure is probably a blessing in disguise are you suggesting that maybe something is going to use at the time of current

218
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
Was working I blow it out

219
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Because I totally believe you

220
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
On

221
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:51,328
Curved really don't have that much protection but it's nice to see you 66 cans are like

222
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,192
We tallaght to higher voltages in Google High Enough eventually no clampdown

223
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
You get a girl pretty hi before messages of the chat

224
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,680
I think I think lava the problem

225
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
It's ok there is really two ways I can go about this the one way that I was thinking is I have

226
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
Pull-up in Charlestown

227
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,712
Armin prefers

228
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
So the first I was thinking about having it is you have a y

229
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Spy

230
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
32

231
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,120
Let's a master for a whole bunch of these little slaves

232
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
Armpit all

233
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
Sitting out here

234
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
In what I wanted to do was only have to run two wires to them and have the charge pump sitting in them

235
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
Reading light stupid idea

236
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
Especially since you know it is going to produce your signal

237
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
Play music by be able to arbitrary have a single one and be able to provide the power locally

238
00:38:53,952 --> 00:39:00,096
Would be to have

239
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
A battery

240
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,520
Along with the this guy

241
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
Are they 82

242
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
Hey baby

243
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:18,528
5 and then within here have the

244
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,976
Really terrible thing going in but have these be completely self-contained and they also have like

245
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
I am you

246
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
And then the charge pump becomes much more attractive so really wanted to least give it a shot first

247
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
I was hoping to just

248
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,432
Tell yes I thought about using one of the lower lower voltage but I just

249
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
Couldn't find any good ones when I want to digitally I actually made an order for several of them I do and

250
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,392
Can you try them out eventually

251
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:01,792
But I haven't got any chance to try them out I was picking up flight just in general purpose off

252
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
Ok

253
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
12 MHz 1

254
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,984
I've got to do

255
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,504
15 MHz

256
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
Voltage

257
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,368
This one word

258
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,672
What is just

259
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
I know I wanna

260
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:35,840
I want to crazy things I'll try it out this one will operate within the right Ranger not

261
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,168
I might be going back to it

262
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Viola

263
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,008
I just don't know

264
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
I mean

265
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
What's the temperature range from thing first cos it's funny fails miserably ok I'll give off

266
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,760
So you know what

267
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,624
Probably happening way to slow what's increase the frequency of charge

268
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,656
So

269
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
Filmmaking

270
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,856
Open off duplex in us to play

271
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:43,168
Oh yeah

272
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,583
Not the 5.2 5.3 volts

273
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
Just not gonna cut it

274
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,871
That's interesting the second stage isn't getting anything

275
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,487
Ok time for us to go get out

276
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,887
Play Guns and far is La Zenia concerned

277
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,287
I was able to borrow

278
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,407
Will seal a logic analyser

279
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:08,159
I just realised I've never installed the harbour for the offer for that on this computer

280
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
I have to do that

281
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
Also while on adverts

282
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
Probably wire on some terminal

283
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Set up

284
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,519
Actually

285
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,919
Trailer

286
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,759
Stole the analyser

287
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:45,439
Maybe it's working soon

288
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:52,863
First thing no satellite use the ground

289
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,775
Hair salon destroy my remote table

290
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
Can you see that no scam

291
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,303
I'm amplifying and completely correct I don't think this is going to work

292
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
White

293
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:32,031
I have never let ridiculous ads200 between me and

294
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Hoops learning some things

295
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:54,047
That's that one right now it's also monitor

296
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,375
The two charge pumpkins

297
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
And

298
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,599
Smarter

299
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,863
Are the ones on the way on the way out

300
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,983
Remember what the maximum voltage are

301
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,343
Yes ban

302
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,743
That's actually a really good point I could have gotten around all of this in just plug the stupid thing into a car

303
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
Where's the flying on from there

304
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,983
Believable way to do it

305
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,847
I've already started down this path now

306
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:23,647
That and I normally don't have the same lie so it was just by like that

307
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,975
How long will be the same this time

308
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,639
Ben are you a hardware engineer or a software engineer

309
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,071
Blog

310
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:36,255
Oh I missed the software engineer who is about 10-years further down the same path you're on

311
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
Call

312
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:44,447
I actually got my degree in computer engineering and then I went back to get my

313
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751
In computer science

314
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,847
I realized I didn't like computer science but I was stuck in it

315
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,943
So I do hardware on the weekends

316
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:05,695
Accepting light survive which how I am getting stuck with because that's all software inside

317
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,255
Hope to my friends are smart enough to

318
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:13,887
Help out with any of the higher level Maths stuff cos I am not not Savvy

319
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,735
Turn alarm in bed work in lots of crazy projects yeah

320
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,783
I hope to Sunday

321
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:37,695
Get to the point where my project if I even get started it will be a feed to get started

322
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Aldi

323
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
Something unbelievably difficult

324
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:48,191
Hey so f****** the ground had a huge loop that is so bad

325
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
Leeds 0BH phase 1

326
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,991
Pcs2

327
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:20,191
You

328
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:32,991
Hand

329
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:52,191
Add sound using I've never even

330
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:58,591
And I guess it's necessary for high-frequency start but

331
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:04,991
Ok ask me what is this thing look like

332
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
That is interesting

333
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,791
This one

334
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:56,191
Is the charge pump in the intended

335
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,991
Negative

336
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
Capture fast right click start

337
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Oh yeah I know I know I know I just turned off all the digital

338
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Turn all of the unused one but I don't really very quickly right now

339
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,591
Dislike all of this is happening

340
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:40,991
Exit

341
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,391
It's probably fine

342
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,591
Switch a roo lyrics

343
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,791
Brand new ones have 0 black and I have one of them

344
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
Euro is ground and Zeros black

345
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:38,591
I wish I could afford one of these but like if people sold them on eBay used I will probably buy them by

346
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,991
I have not found any on eBay

347
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:04,191
Go for

348
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,991
Interesting so wow this is real

349
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:23,391
Ok then I'll buy that I will buy the way tune

350
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,791
The noises in the

351
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:36,191
Ok anyway

352
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:42,591
Stoneleigh

353
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
0.7 volt

354
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:55,391
Switching it wrong should be spiking down

355
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,791
Clear 13

356
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
Set 13

357
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:14,591
Very nice

358
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:45,311
Play clean of Dance and Theatre

359
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
Singer on folder

360
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:09,119
Are Tommy and I wish I was following this chat thread

361
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
Off

362
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,247
Ok I'll see what is going on now

363
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
Hey buddy

364
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:40,607
9.23 V

365
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,495
That looks pretty sweet

366
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
That's terrible

367
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:56,991
Interesting that looks like the Beacons wonder why that would make me sober

368
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
Why would there be

369
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:07,999
I'm 2926 huge voltage difference

370
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,399
Have you any tomorrow at 3.30 Rail

371
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,271
See what about look like

372
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:17,119
Oh yeah that is what's going on

373
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:23,775
What's 8 drop in the VCC of light rays in the

374
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,335
Charge pump

375
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Ok charge pump long-term knock in the world for right now let's just see what happens

376
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:39,391
So with that now we know the charge pump works

377
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,463
There's no one that's gone

378
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:51,167
Disappeared

379
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
Oh hey

380
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,303
We check that out slowly Reading

381
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
10.3 a

382
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,471
Nice salad 10.3 8

383
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,287
Has golden what did that

384
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,199
Hahaha crazy

385
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:39,039
Increasingly charge pump frequency cleans up the rail that match

386
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
Right now

387
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,391
Killarney

388
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,487
Meaning of the problem maybe I just need my card from frequency higher

389
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:05,919
OKC what does that look like

390
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
First starts it is very angry when it first starts

391
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:19,231
ESP is like wanting to cause face off

392
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:22,815
Why is it gets moving now

393
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,143
Pigs

394
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,799
That's a long time for s kids up to

395
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,895
1.38 but this is really nice

396
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,271
That's very hard

397
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,879
Split up by factor of

398
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,279
Cialis must be going on this

399
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,607
Cars in the snot excuse fast as I would like

400
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:16,575
Grade that has to be wild

401
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:32,959
Then I could totally believe that if I would stick like a little ld-001 bit downstream

402
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,983
Off another ball

403
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:40,383
That would probably clean the sub Ally

404
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,847
Pumping down what did I do damn

405
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,479
Switch off right now

406
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,839
Gorgeous

407
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
Simply gorgeous

408
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,959
Play scala 10.3 a 12

409
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,751
Ok

410
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,871
What does see what voltages

411
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,199
Is the totally open right now on voltages are coming out

412
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,551
3.6 cos that has a limiter on it

413
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:12,095
No I didn't check should have made sure

414
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,703
The photodiodes and Times news

415
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:21,311
Don't have a maximum voltage Reading

416
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,207
32 V

417
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:43,839
Ok I think we're fine

418
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:51,935
Turn off the

419
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,335
Lighthouses that are called

420
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:40,831
Turn on

421
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,695
What's the news

422
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:53,375
It's ok yay

423
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:02,847
I hear you're terrible I ever

424
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:09,247
I will admit aar has done some things and assembly that I have

425
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:15,391
I would never kick the Buddy

426
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,695
Turn time on

427
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:22,303
Everything else surrounding it is gonna be off from it

428
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:29,215
Kyle I don't know

429
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,615
Ben I'm really curious what do you think about straight up

430
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:14,015
GCC GCC is my go-to Elan commercial systems now

431
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:20,415
For a long time I was kind of stuck in the world of proprietary compilers but eventually

432
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:26,815
Gave off

433
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:33,215
Does anyone else here

434
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:39,615
Turn off the light on my radio does anybody else here actually really prefer any of the other environment

435
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:46,015
Like more than GCC on

436
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,415
I have I've met people who used to feel that way and

437
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:58,815
I have never used fly

438
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:05,215
I don't laugh with avr-gcc

439
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:11,615
Trouble with it recently really needs the dash fl20 flag to do anything

440
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:18,015
And I don't know I've had a hard time with Dash fl20

441
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:24,159
I see you do anything useful when used Ash flt use up much

442
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,695
Lights last for

443
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,047
Match match last

444
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
Codebase

445
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:51,807
LBC

446
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:59,487
I'm really choose to hate then so when you say climb what what

447
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:05,887
What is systems this clang run on because I have heard nothing but good things that climb

448
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,983
Do I have heard limited things about climb

449
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,287
And and white screen clang

450
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:29,855
Now write about all of the charge pump circuit

451
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,951
Volume to connect

452
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:43,679
I think the TL Dr from that is yes you can

453
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:50,079
Charge pumps on the esp8266 yes they work no they're not clean or

454
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Liable

455
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Settle

456
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,759
The mileage may vary

457
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:05,183
GoPro

458
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:18,751
The probe input minus

459
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,271
Going to probe input - as it goes into the chip

460
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:36,671
Going to probe

461
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:43,071
Output

462
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:49,471
That's not gonna come off

463
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Into the streets

464
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:08,671
Turn off now

465
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
Play me some Spotify for ldm

466
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:47,071
Does Aldi on actually support 80 hours in actually second question

467
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:53,471
How old I am support in Celica if it does I will be really tempted

468
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:59,871
Go fourth on his name

469
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:06,271
TVR sorry his jslinux towards the

470
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:12,671
The esp8266 so I will be able to have a browser that could

471
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:19,071
Compile the code to take c code and compile it in the browser for the processor I think that

472
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:25,471
Really cool

473
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,871
So I want to reverse by

474
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:38,271
Estate agents

475
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:44,671
What side into the minor and hope it doesn't blow up

476
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:10,271
Straight on

477
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:07,871
Cd236 girls it's just take them

478
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:20,671
6455 is the

479
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
Yes

480
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:59,071
Power Force

481
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:05,471
That's just a complete mess

482
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:11,871
I'm saying

483
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:18,271
This is a new girl

484
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
Should be there too

485
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:31,071
How do I why have you

486
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:37,471
Vue

487
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:43,871
How do I view the

488
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:50,271
Show us me and hair 120

489
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,927
In between

490
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,047
Mirrors this absolute terrifying

491
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,399
Charge pump

492
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,471
Ok fine

493
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:18,080
So plans

494
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,128
You and 3

495
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,528
2

496
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:30,368
2 and 3

497
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:37,536
2 - 3 is

498
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:24,384
Ok the apology of this is not gonna work and definitely need a different topology

499
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,392
Who is the 93.3 v

500
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:41,792
I was just concerned about mediate not having a higher frequency response

501
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:46,400
Honestly inside just assumed that would be a bad thing so

502
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,448
I didn't even go for it

503
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,032
Well I'm really curious why this is not

504
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,632
Really confused by channel sixs not

505
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:45,280
Ok maybe I will just back out and will just use the door

506
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,840
Turn up

507
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:54,240
A bit more but I have a feeling that we will be switching out to

508
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
Sky Radio

509
01:23:56,032 --> 01:24:01,408
The ts460 2

510
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,456
Can you give that a shot

511
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,552
Expensive 60 piece

512
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:21,888
The perfect frequency response frequency response

513
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:28,288
Ok that's why I didn't have no idea

514
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
Does

515
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,176
Hello if my five nights

516
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,024
Quiet signal

517
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,320
Oh my gosh it's also cooking itself

518
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:18,976
Discharge from thing which is done

519
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:28,192
Alan did tweeter Center schematic for Callum sensor schematic on is for it

520
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,984
Rewind it have the enveloping

521
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:36,640
Which I do not want

522
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:49,184
What was life like before

523
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:07,360
That's a good point then if I use a schematic I would still be able to use the RPM in the flying from

524
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,664
Just have to chop off the background

525
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,760
You make entirely too much sense

526
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:33,728
What am I looking at

527
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:41,152
I don't know which I'll be able to use this when it goes mind looking up which I thought was

528
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:55,232
Yes you can look it up right now I'm using a solo

529
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,584
Can you tell me look up the

530
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,936
Add the schematic

531
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,240
Yates get up

532
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:19,808
Yankee

533
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,112
That really is going to get some sort of colour

534
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,000
Pause

535
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,216
News

536
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:08,960
I'm thinking it is best to bandon this now because I'm not really sure how we change the architect

537
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:43,776
I mean I guess I never thought that but now that

538
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
I mean

539
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:48,640
Does not from across the room but

540
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,832
Pretty cleared

541
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,976
2.9 x 2.7

542
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,792
Mask

543
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,864
What is this

544
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,056
How well

545
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
The TC whatever needs on

546
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,672
Is the higher voltage

547
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,424
Can you start in Cluedo

548
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,016
Just a comparator

549
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,160
What speed

550
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,912
Propagation delay that long

551
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:20,288
Put that shorter response

552
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,944
No no I got it I just up here when I look

553
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:33,344
Anyway I was looking to Reading

554
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,440
Ok anyway

555
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:42,304
What does the actual response time look like so sad

556
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,352
Fast enough

557
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,192
500 seconds

558
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:57,408
What is the phase delay or for Just Can't respond that fast

559
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:01,504
Turn the lights off

560
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:11,488
Hello hardest with operated that's so long time

561
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,400
The envelope comparator ok that makes more

562
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:21,984
Anybody gets me what the the office lamp

563
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:27,360
I'm using at the front and that would be super cool right now though

564
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,200
I will leave me

565
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,272
I don't think there is anyway

566
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:40,416
There is no way this is going to get cleaned up good enough to use

567
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:49,632
Misses the signal and that is the noise and this is the signal like a foot

568
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,728
Cell

569
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:03,968
I wonder how the size of the compared to the size on

570
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:11,648
Please guys

571
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:54,400
Currently I was just gonna decouple it and put it into captain

572
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:59,520
Just take a peek at it

573
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,432
Sexy hair

574
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:37,408
Oh buddy

575
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:43,808
Haha I am going to need a different photodiode to

576
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:50,208
This is downright embarrassing

577
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,608
Why can't I take a picture

578
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:03,008
Wrong

579
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:44,224
Camera

580
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:22,624
Taking more pictures

581
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:44,288
What did you want to do mt4

582
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:50,688
What did you want medium out of

583
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:40,864
Yeah we are the Dion that guy looks way bigger than the online but that's still

584
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,936
Only need about 2 different stuff

585
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:50,336
By the way are the bump in the signal is definitely from the light now

586
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:56,736
You can see the the bump here and there

587
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,552
YouTube on from The Sweet

588
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:06,208
And it's my house is currently in a mode so you can see that somebody in the summer bit further

589
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:12,608
Definitely from the Lighthouse the box themselves I believe should be Spaced

590
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:19,008
8.8 Ms or 16.6 between the pair and it's 6

591
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:25,408
Sex between the pair

592
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,456
What's the noise of the charge pump

593
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,272
That's unfortunate

594
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,320
On

595
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:38,976
Actually I think about it

596
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:45,376
You extra components those that there

597
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:51,776
Spite of common mode so

598
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,104
Resistor between here and 12th

599
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,176
That should bring it back in the common mode

600
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:03,808
Maybe

601
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:10,464
10K

602
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:49,376
Zoom out

603
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:16,000
Why is such a specific frequency thats not even on the ntsd frequency is it

604
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:22,400
No it's only the 90s

605
01:40:54,656 --> 01:41:00,800
Not really need this signal anymore

606
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:32,800
I'm just maybe eutectic

607
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:39,200
Turn on use business Saturdays you get something if the junction that you don't want very rare

608
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:45,600
Hilarious

609
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:36,800
Where is the car

610
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:43,200
No action playing any response

611
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:15,200
That's embarrassing

612
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:28,000
Why is my voltage so low

613
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:40,800
2.9 volts

614
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:53,600
Tired

615
01:43:53,856 --> 01:44:00,000
Yeah

616
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:06,400
Service to voltage drop there

617
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:12,800
Curious if I drop the charge from frequency of that

618
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:19,200
Improve music by I'm guessing probably not

619
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:32,000
7.7 microseconds in hours

620
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:51,200
Why is it

621
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:57,600
Now yeah

622
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:23,200
Lighthouse stuff

623
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:36,000
Stephanie above and below but I don't see any app

624
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:42,400
Oh that's really rough on the ESP

625
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:55,200
DVLA open

626
01:45:55,456 --> 01:46:01,600
Ok

627
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:08,000
I get a 9-volt battery but I don't think it's going to get any better I'm pretty sure that apology

628
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:14,400
And I should probably give up on this apology

629
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:27,200
Maybe another day maybe another day

630
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:40,000
No I have a resistor between the the apple in the GP I opened it will ya

631
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:46,400
Actually has a funky bit of protection circuitry on the inputs it's so that you can drive

632
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:52,800
Portsmouth V even higher won't hurt it but I don't know

633
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:59,200
We've ever actually come out and said with the maximum voltage you can put on the prince's but no

634
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:05,600
I do have the resistor there I have a resistor right here that goes into the i2s I think

635
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
The 10K resistor but there is almost no power being dropped on it because the ESB

636
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:18,400
Funky like that

637
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:24,800
Yes almost zero

638
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:31,200
Turbo battery

639
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,056
Don't try this at home kids

640
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:30,912
Do you wanna say now

641
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:44,224
Recompile

642
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,840
Is this coming from

643
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,016
White

644
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,600
What's what's going on

645
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,960
Where is the noise coming from

646
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Play

647
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:52,320
Tell 019 leaving connected

648
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:56,160
What they're saying the same noise that everything else is doing

649
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,512
Getting weird

650
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,072
Somewhere

651
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:12,288
Maybe the ESP is causing the ear mouth

652
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:27,648
Look like

653
01:52:57,344 --> 01:53:00,928
Well apparently if you get loud enough you can see the outfit

654
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:06,816
Sinclair 6 volts

655
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:44,192
Still that

656
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,544
The words comments on

657
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:19,008
Askew

658
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,904
Sweet that's 1.8 MHz carrier

659
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:44,352
Yeah I start driving with charge pump on a wire make sure I stop driving and I'm getting really

660
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,632
Confused

661
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:30,176
Soap in one is now tied to the pin that the charge pump cos I'm still there is

662
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,200
Play nothing there

663
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:34,272
It is absolutely

664
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:37,344
Play Pretty Queen

665
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,440
Slimming by noises coming from somewhere else

666
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,232
Not sure where

667
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:50,912
Disable the Wi-Fi in the ESP

668
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:24,960
Is the Wi-Fi engine the spy put the nail in the coffin

669
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,496
Resolving

670
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:41,600
Why is the Wi-Fi engine in the ESP so noisy

671
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,904
No no it's still happening this

672
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:48,512
It doesn't call for now so you don't know this it's ok nevermind

673
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:14,880
What's the

674
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:42,528
Definitely did not go the way I was playing

675
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,856
Nothing I had a plan b

676
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:56,608
Expected more than just how the charge pump works perfectly and nothing else works

677
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:01,216
Yes the charge pump is about the simplest part though

678
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:39,104
This guy looks like

679
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,736
Pretty big difference

680
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:32,864
Yeah you can be the 1.8 MHz signal at first but

681
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:39,008
What in the world is that

682
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:44,640
That was

683
01:59:54,624 --> 02:00:00,000
Now there is definitely a maths somewhere else right now the esp8266 is off

684
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:40,192
The world is going on in my house be causing this

685
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:11,936
Maybe actually you know you can find out what's causing this

686
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:16,544
Gpio0 is now disconnected

687
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:22,944
Look at that glorious noise that it is exactly the frequency of the terrible

688
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:30,624
Ok where in the world is that coming from

689
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,440
Tell me the laptop

690
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:41,632
That changed much

691
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:48,288
Probably close down song

692
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:04,672
Disconnect everything else now because at least we can figure out where this noises coming from help me tomorrow

693
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:12,608
Everything on Ford

694
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:17,216
Play The Noise goes away just just like that

695
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:26,944
OK how am I supposed to divide this seriously

696
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,528
Instagram backup

697
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:50,752
So I'm going to go take me there and their

698
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:57,152
Here here

699
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:06,368
I'm in Harriet as a huge ground there's no way this would work

700
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:12,000
Stupid

701
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:39,904
No the problem is that the sailor is grounded to my desktop

702
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:45,280
As is the power for this thing

703
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:56,544
Now if I unplug

704
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,456
No

705
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:06,016
Something else is still going on here

706
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:21,120
Still the same

707
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:23,424
Stupid

708
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:25,728
What is the theory on Earth

709
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,824
9.6 microseconds

710
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,456
What in the world happened at 9.6 microseconds

711
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,264
Ok white

712
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:25,120
I get the Oscars

713
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:27,424
Amplitude

714
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:31,264
Hello

715
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:38,432
Bigger

716
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,512
No way

717
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:17,344
I'm jumping to conclusions here

718
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:24,768
But I'm thinking I spent a little bit too little money on the power supply in my computer

719
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:27,328
Because

720
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:35,264
This little black here is what I touched the shell of the power supply with my finger

721
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:38,848
The syllable is filled

722
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,152
With that same

723
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:44,992
Period of awful noise

724
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:53,184
No it's ok nevermind

725
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:58,304
I jump to conclusions

726
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,216
That is

727
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:14,432
I know it's 9.1 microseconds

728
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:26,208
Alan plug everything

729
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:32,096
Unplug this

730
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:38,496
Actually I can test my theory really fast what I can do is I can switch off recurring my laptop

731
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:44,128
Add xsh cam

732
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:54,112
Hi

733
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,720
Ok and you guys still get taxed

734
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:05,120
Unplug the sale a

735
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:15,360
Plug-in here

736
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:23,520
I got bad news guys I don't think it's a laptop

737
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:31,456
Cars

738
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:37,856
That's my touch the computer ok next step is turn off the desktop

739
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:26,496
How I said shut down

740
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:36,736
Does anything

741
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:42,880
Please

742
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:46,720
Updown

743
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:57,216
My desktop is now off

744
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:31,008
It's just a normal 60hz for my house now

745
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:39,968
Ok

746
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:44,320
I bought a Chinese power supply that was too cheap

747
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:46,624
And

748
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,440
It is nothing everything off

749
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:03,264
I've have mine just joking my my desktop up to jumpers to my

750
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:06,080
Track right now

751
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:12,480
Sounds like the radiator though is to be honest apple in a bit the charge pump is possible

752
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:16,320
I don't think it would have that much noise actually

753
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,112
We can find out

754
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:24,256
Send speed now saying with spy laptop here

755
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:27,072
Get Paul

756
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,520
I forgot the name

757
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:47,296
My PSU is a funky Chinese 12-volt

758
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,832
Power supply

759
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,112
Strip

760
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,392
Name

761
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:55,488
Which was not intended for use in a computer

762
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:02,656
Go on the computer just doesn't work really well for everybody else around me

763
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:23,136
On 5-years

764
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:30,048
Plugging everything else backyard

765
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:59,232
I use a pico PSU for all the 99 12:00 trails

766
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:03,840
I didn't really start thinking as DVR

767
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,936
Other supply would be

768
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:20,128
Undone

769
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:11,328
This one you - which is this one

770
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:17,728
I want to probe

771
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:30,528
I want a pro but going into the SP

772
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:49,728
Oh my gosh

773
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:56,128
Also way too loud but

774
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:08,928
Oh my god

775
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:15,328
So crystal Clear I'm taking a reasonable thing to do if we we are

776
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:21,728
Use this to help clear that is oh wow

777
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:34,528
That is interesting that

778
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:40,928
What daily dose response time isn't actually is good is it

779
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:47,328
Pause

780
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:53,728
I guess I have to increase the resistance of the pull-up

781
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:19,328
Actually I really should have a ground loop

782
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:25,728
Cheap ones are USB 3.0

783
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:32,128
Man oh ok so the answer is there's really no

784
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:38,528
Problem with the charge pump system

785
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:44,928
It is rock solid

786
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:51,328
Queen

787
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:57,728
Plus 3

788
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:04,128
What's going on there

789
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:10,528
6-months

790
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:23,328
True that

791
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:29,728
Going into the SP

792
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:42,528
So clear

793
02:21:55,584 --> 02:22:01,728
Something's just her

794
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:08,128
The wrong turn

795
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:14,528
That's the charge pumpkin

796
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:20,928
Crystal clear so clean you just don't

797
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:27,328
What's going into the ESPC

798
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:33,728
Weird

799
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:40,128
Might 141 into the home voltage

800
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:59,328
Sure why

801
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:05,728
Not really care at this point I think it's just the wrong

802
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:12,128
Wake me up in the wrong solution

803
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:18,528
Thank you everybody for sticking around

804
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:24,928
Yeah this is just

805
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:31,328
Ok sure what's crank it

806
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:37,728
Play The One That Really Care

807
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:44,128
Free that has the power come

808
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:50,528
The charge pump

809
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:56,928
Cos that's the one that's going off the main system and I can do that at 50 so

810
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:16,128
Trousers mess of wires in

811
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:22,528
Yeah I am I'm looking hearing I don't see anything

812
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:28,928
Any sign of that charge pump being sad gold

813
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:41,728
Well that was fun

814
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:48,128
Definitely going to have to play with us some more though

815
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:59,648
Thanks for tuning in everyone this was fun

816
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:06,816
Yeah

817
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,120
So

818
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:13,984
How long till we hackaday worthy but it definitely looks like you can

819
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:17,056
Can definitely get a charge pump running on an EST

820
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:24,480
And ESP doesn't seem to care if you shave 6 volt input so that's kind me too

821
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,064
Thank you everyone for coming out it was a lot of fun
