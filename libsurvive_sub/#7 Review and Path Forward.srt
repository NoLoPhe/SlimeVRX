1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Thank you for coming out to the 7th alive survive live stream and things

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
Cooking along I was just really surprised by how much people have gotten together online and just very

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,920
Things that we found out we've needed along the way and really this project has been so much

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:24,320
Bigger than I expected it to be I figured we just get some like no scandalous and lions and just throw it in there

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
Turn the light white

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's for the hmd and all the Watchmen are and everything else is working really actually

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
I'm only going to room always assuming and the smallest person there that really ready to admit that I'm not and this is definitely

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
Close x

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,104
The problem of what does the HTC vive is doing is a lot bigger than I thought it was

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
So one of the things we ran into towards the end of the last live stream was

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
A comment from from Alan youths basically like well I guess it's the best he's going to be able to do be

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,720
Cotx kaldata

13
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
Really is it really that important in the experience yeah yeah really important so I had

14
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:14,496
Joshua he was my roommate in college for many years we are

15
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
We actually worked on a game engine together for several years to

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
Can help answer all the answers like yes you can be killed some 0tx data

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
So for those of you guys who don't know what it is is the

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,536
The data that comes from the lighthouses because there is no

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,472
There is no mechanism easily for the lighthouses to send data

20
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
To anything else except for

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,176
Peruvian true the white coming out of lighthouses in the sink passes

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
The sync pulses artist

23
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,624
Guess what can you find find the video and will pull

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
I'm in anyway pointers it's a fairly complicated protocol on dealing with a lot

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
Wacky did stuffing stuff just like the crazy bencoding on the Watchmen and Josh

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
Take that and turned into something actionable

27
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Arm

28
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
Soa

29
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,456
I think you just do view imgur whatever it would probably be fine

30
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
So you still pulling their dad

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,672
So see here sorry about all the streaming issues earlier to

32
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Anyway so thanks for coming everybody so we've got a number of things people are coming up a little bit

33
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
More recently than before mw10 is really happening in his too

34
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
Project initially we were going to do everything strictly with the headset and the Watchmen

35
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,736
Looking kind of important that we do something a little bit more generic

36
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
On to see guys know

37
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
I just pulled up the imagery here

38
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
On this is what a base station looks like this is an early version of Playstation in specifically the o

39
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,608
The X8 is what's included in these flashes which are specifically coded length of time

40
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,496
In order to actually transmit the calibration information about the Watchmen

41
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,384
Actually works one bit at a time so each flash you get one bit

42
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,480
And then there has to be

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
2

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Reveal the entire free

45
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
Talk about it more into how how you do

46
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Basically the weather at work's is

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Digital console it looks for the

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,264
18 preamble 1700 by 1 and once it picks up on that

49
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,640
It starts pushing the individual bits into a buffer and once it reaches

50
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Transfer device

51
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,600
Has a call back and let the library handle what it wants to do list

52
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
What's the date

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
If you leave it open for a minute sorry the people didn't see so what was going on is this

54
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
That's right here

55
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
And this the two rotors but it's this flash that happens and that is a

56
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Play coded length of time

57
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
Ok and you can pull off

58
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
Thesaurus

59
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
I said this to always there

60
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,999
That's good yeah

61
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
Ok so some of the things that are that we've done since last time was that and another big one

62
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,031
Taking for me at least I don't know how big it is for other people

63
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
B

64
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
Call open the Sky

65
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,247
For me I was able to

66
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
Calibre

67
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
So right now what you guys are getting

68
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
To see that clearly

69
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Stop

70
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Scanner

71
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
This should probably be

72
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,527
It is a broken fan laptop sounds like an engine

73
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:52,255
Sweet just means I can actually monitor while

74
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Ok

75
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
This

76
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
There's you guys can see what's going on with it

77
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,639
So right over here I have a

78
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
Play that we've been using for some time

79
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
Is the X and Y you from each of the two lighthouses there in there

80
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,423
As well

81
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Here

82
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
On

83
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
Turn the camera off

84
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
Surround you can see

85
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,623
Changing the time

86
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
Sometimes when they're charging

87
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
One of the fine soon so really happens here is

88
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
Are we have

89
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,159
Survive Albert

90
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
01652 you guys can see it

91
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,887
Thank you

92
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,687
Good for you guys can you see everything clearly

93
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Is that

94
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,279
On going to assume that selection with smallest lights

95
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
Ok that's going inside of survive cow it contains a state machine which

96
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Through all of the

97
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,687
The the different states in which we would want a cow

98
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
So I'll walk you through it looks like right now

99
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
So I can just rang calibrate

100
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879



101
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
Piranha headset

102
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
And if I

103
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
So now

104
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
I have Watford won in Watchmen 2

105
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,775
Start that again see you see what happens when it first starts

106
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
Look at the very top of the screen it is collecting 0tx data 0 0 and then those numbers count up

107
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,831
You're counting to b number in which the OT x is currently receiving

108
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,159
The base stations

109
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,815
Please watch while I can put down on the ground

110
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,703
It's going to try to find a common of point on the Watchmen

111
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
That was a little bit quick

112
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Probably not gonna work out

113
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,759
So it's really a collecting sweet data internally

114
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,111
I'm so this was something that was kind of done before in a very Emanuel fashion

115
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
But now it's pretty much automatic

116
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,095
Search collecting the data with the Watchmen in the hmd underground and all of that

117
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,983
And then what it's going to do is going to go round the find the Lighthouse find algorithm

118
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
I'm the date

119
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
And B Rock

120
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,455
Think that's probably kind of wrong but that's no reasonable data

121
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,343
For where the where the white houses are stores that back in the data structure

122
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
Your life survive so now it's actually able to do a room calibration inside

123
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Self

124
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
It doesn't really do

125
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
That

126
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Match the artist

127
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,831
So that's that's really kind of like the new thing is that now we can

128
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,647
Inside of the

129
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,023
Inside of Life survive itself there is the mechanism for self-calibration

130
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
Now this is only going to change because I was mentioning mw20 want to be able to use this

131
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Stone hardware instead of just specifically they are Watchmen sorry to Watchmen

132
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
And a mean

133
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
So we are going to have to change some of that

134
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
The other thing I really wanted to talk about today was the pose estimation information

135
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Until right now

136
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
The way that we actually do the camera finding

137
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
There's only two ways that we've been playing with it one is the way I do it in the others the way that MW Charlie does it

138
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:22,751
Why does it using a series of Tories like Taurus

139
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,663
Where is it difficult to describe and see if I can have

140
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
I can pull that up here

141
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
By the way if you're curious about hopping in and getting things going on the github issues are pretty good place to do it

142
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Here

143
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
A solution for this

144
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,871
Add much more to do with finding the relative distances between

145
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,455
Quite so - much more to do with

146
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Simulation of an environment in the moving a camera and a whole bunch of places in trying to find the best possible location

147
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
I'm he's on the other hand

148
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
Has much more to do with

149
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
I think it maybe it was good

150
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Leacock

151
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Sorry this two guys confused so frequently

152
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,311
Looks like my Chinese so for his it produces a series of possible

153
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,199
Armed forces of where the where the lighthouses could be

154
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
Armin goes from there mine is just a fundamentally different way where it simulator

155
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
The lighthouse on

156
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
Oh my gosh it's so smooth on this compare

157
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
What I do

158
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
What does show us the probability of where the

159
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
So if I do this he owes me

160
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
The chances are that the Lighthouse for

161
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
The lighthouses probably somewhere in there

162
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
And

163
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
Dr Whitehouse is somewhere over there

164
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
Canon rock solo

165
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
Show the doors going to be some more work done two

166
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
And resolve that

167
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
But doesn't really two different approaches

168
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,247
Yeah that would work that way

169
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
However I really wanted to go into though was the discussion of what's really going on

170
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,535
Here with mine and why I think that is kind of a fundamentally bad way of doing

171
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
On

172
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,631
So what time effectively trying to do

173
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,215
Is I pretend that we have at the origin

174
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,847
The hmd that's the head-mounted display that sitting right there on the floor

175
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
And I'm calling that my origin

176
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
And then

177
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
What I do is I iterate through an agency this is Vauxhall so it's a bunch of

178
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
On the street like checks I say if the camera or the light

179
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
What was at this point right here

180
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Right there

181
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
Would that work with that produce a

182
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
Is that visible can you

183
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,799
Can you put up on your screensaver

184
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Does that work

185
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Sodium

186
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
What do I do if I try it every single but possible location and I say will ok

187
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:57,023
The lighthouse at the origin with this particular properties and move around and

188
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
And all of that

189
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Then

190
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
What is the probability that that's where the Lighthouse could be

191
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
Can I produce the scrap of all of that

192
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,847
Now that's that's the backwards way of thinking about it turns out

193
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
What I really wanted to do with the use that dissolve with lighthouses work as we do need to know it like

194
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
You can also use that to determine where the headset itself is

195
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
So both directions back to a comment that telling you

196
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
Play the end of the live stream I believe with livestream number 3 when we had

197
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Single lighthouse pointed it headset and he's like yeah find out where the headset is and Michael that seems useless

198
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,991
We should have two lighthouses in go from there but really if you can figure out

199
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Where are given object is

200
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
From one lighthouses point of view in figure out where does from the other lighthouses point of you you can go a long way to

201
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,791
Solving with the actual object is and I think that's the direction I want to head

202
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
I think I wanted to scrap this solution and this mechanism for finding the lighthouses and instead writes

203
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Code

204
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,567
Try to find a location of an object based on its angles

205
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
And then use the code in Reverse to find lighthouse and then use the code

206
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,063
Normally once the Lighthouse is fine for everything else

207
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
So

208
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,647
Armex that one change I want to make

209
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
We have anything else at the moment for the introduction summary

210
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Demonstration

211
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,495
Let's see what are people chatting about right now

212
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
Yeah like survivors Tron really low end systems goal is minimized

213
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
To use minimise requirements

214
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
And yes potentially even run on the

215
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Run on the

216
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,071
This visualisation here of the probability cloud cannot be Run in real time

217
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
Are as it is

218
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:15,007
But it's most because there is no real data for to be processing in Real-Time

219
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,895
I think it'll be a lot of fun to try to figure out some way of streaming data to a web page dynamically

220
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
That would be a lot of fun

221
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
I don't have any data to do that with right now

222
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Arm

223
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
So

224
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
Not really sure where to go from there

225
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:43,167
Some of the other things I wanted to mention so right now all over wipes survive is

226
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Lovely status

227
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
So if you look inside of

228
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Survive internal that age

229
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,271
On there is a structure for the survived contacts

230
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Which has a line of basic stuff in

231
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
I'm in here there's a lot of this

232
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,143
Functions and another start that have to do with really

233
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,983
Specifically headset into Watchmen data

234
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
Like here we have

235
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
The data structure that contains

236
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
The

237
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
The headset in The Watchmen

238
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,783
And really this this should be switched out to be much more of a

239
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Over

240
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Of various arm

241
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
There's really no reason for it to be

242
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Hard-coded in here

243
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
Have seen heard wrong button before tab

244
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
2fb

245
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
What is that

246
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Hello are we out of sync

247
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
I guess I'll wait until we find out what people say

248
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
But yeah Vauxhall tastic was not meant for dynamic data but I think totally wrong

249
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
You know my other favourite technology websockets

250
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Arm

251
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
So one of the things that were going to need to do with people that have driver registration in this is a scimitar

252
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
From what we used on on coloured cord

253
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,223
And what that allows you to do with something like coloured cord let me go check that out

254
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
So what you can do is you can write code that will be a driver for giving device or

255
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
Actually a calibration system

256
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
And then

257
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,551
Instead of having to haven't like a bunch of complicated switch statements or anything else that will check a certain driver

258
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
You can simply

259
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Register

260
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Your driver

261
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
And that can just be done right here

262
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
And the really big benefit of this is you can simply link against life survive in

263
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
Be able to have your own drivability and you won't have to recompile live survived and custom new hardware

264
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
Or new fundamental ways

265
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,919
Doing things and life survive it will just be able to be registered in with the driver

266
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575
The other thing is that survivors finally getting big enough now that we really need it

267
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
Systems that's what I was signed by Josh primarily

268
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Do you want me to

269
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
Go over there right now

270
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
Remember they can see the whole thing

271
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
A little bit bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger

272
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
Arm so do you want to talk about it

273
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Well basically the way is going to work is it going to rain

274
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,271
Data out of a json file

275
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
The reading light down yet

276
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
With the writing stuff

277
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
The past

278
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Tower 2

279
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,608
Haven't tried it out yet so it's Friday crashed

280
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
Search the interesting get around doing that

281
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,080
Play configuration load

282
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
I am unfortunately work I never the point now or needs a little bit more boring stuff to get there

283
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,064
Get things moving well

284
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,904
Yeah I don't really know where does suggest from now

285
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
Hello this was

286
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
I guess it was intended to be assured livestream I don't think was intended to be this

287
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,728
But I have everything on my list checked off now it's

288
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
I know what are we

289
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,384
Yeah we do

290
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
What is

291
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Amiga 1000

292
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
What does it have 68007 point 16mhz

293
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
What if I upgraded to 28

294
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Maybe

295
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,792
Is it is 14.4 unit

296
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:31,936
But my I have a 60 30 that runs at 25 and it has a 6881

297
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
OK that'll be fun

298
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,360
Do you have a c compiler for it

299
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
Like a modern development environment

300
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,136
You can code it in tested in a reasonable length of time

301
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:57,024
My question is can I can I work on my desktop and say

302
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,840
To that end

303
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,936
What I mean it could be on the network so you could just walk on it

304
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
But would you see like to be ok

305
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
I don't know

306
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,712
This pretty benign

307
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
I'm trying to figure out what you can set a reminder because he obviously certain things are just not going to be support

308
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
When was GCC 2 created

309
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Larkin you sorry

310
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
Lemmy

311
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
I'm curious will I be able to do GCSE to

312
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,040
I haven't done enough with

313
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,744
XC compiler for me go as m68k

314
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:05,120
Stop in 34

315
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,824
Does no ogc forex does not support m68k

316
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,224
What's 2.95

317
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,856
You're talking here I want to know why all the young people use for tabs for space tabs

318
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,952
How young is young I used to

319
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
You'd better be making them tab

320
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,384
I know you won't be working on because it's so

321
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
Brendon like spy finally hates JavaScript just

322
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
Just

323
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah I don't get Brendan on

324
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:10,400
Ok what else to test right now then we can fire blight survive

325
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Medela

326
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,032
Morning Rose working on earlier was getting the

327
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
YouTube

328
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
It's still running

329
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:25,504
I was getting it so that it would actually be able to find all the lighthouses in save in

330
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
The

331
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
Play that is life JS is love

332
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,464
How are you people are so weird

333
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
On

334
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,656
Yes it is

335
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
Linux 68k

336
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
Would you get the Omega to output to the HTC vibe video

337
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,344
That would be a slow like framerate

338
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:08,256
You know what you're playing if you're playing the live on in Omega you're probably get expected

339
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,096
What times are the best fare

340
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,752
I think my laptop on a standard charge

341
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,224
No lights or 5 is definitely going to stay and see when I went out doing any other

342
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Problems

343
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
So data recorder see if it still runs yeah does so I can still up with this data

344
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,912
Actually no one thing I really wanted to do was

345
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,776
In here what I want to try doing

346
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
Is

347
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,688
I want to try make me to output the imu as well because right now it's just not doing that

348
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
To see if I

349
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
I just fainted in running

350
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,232
Earlier in the week talk about

351
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Recording

352
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
The live data

353
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:21,472
We can play back later on it simulated by

354
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
Continue developing ok that seems like a reasonable time for us to work on live

355
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,944
First I think I do when I get the

356
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,344
See how that work we probably want to make it to you can stream

357
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,952
Because we have this right now streaming to the terminal and then I wrote that to last time

358
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Which farm

359
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
Call

360
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Data server

361
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
So

362
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,104
Can you try taking the Samsung it's a little bit more robust

363
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
One thing I'd like to do anybody who's up for it I would like to try to run the data server again if somebody on the internet

364
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
Connect an and just try that out

365
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,920
I think that would be pretty cool

366
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
On

367
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,088
I had no idea as to what I think was causing the day that Dropout 3 bad before

368
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Arm so

369
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
See if I can

370
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
Don't

371
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
Ok

372
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Yeah it's been raining pretty hard

373
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,568
What what kind of weather

374
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Were you were

375
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,224
No he describes something pretty pretty crazy

376
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:23,840
Weight recording format does does the HTC vive always support actual recording

377
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:32,800
If so I did not realise that in which case I guess I'll be up for trying to

378
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Make it

379
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
He compatible

380
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,784
Arsenal voice in Southern Ireland and he was

381
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
Get a picture on Twitter of something crazy happening

00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
See where is that

383
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Here

384
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,096
Yeah that's definitely here that's really serious stuff

385
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
Sorry that was the strat

386
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
Something I need to

387
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,784
Someone I think there are venue

388
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
Phone of job but enough people wasted they could have experienced that you could make a video of VR experience

389
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Wednesday at work

390
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
On

391
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
Yeah yeah

392
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:40,896
Brendan says Dad eventuary Rider counting just as software instead of accounting

393
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
Show

394
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:57,024
What am I doing is I'm going to make it so it's possible to drop

395
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Packets if you're connected

396
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
In

397
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,752
And if you do drop them it'll be ok for a little bit in there and if you keep dropping on

398
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,408
It will eventually kick you out but I'm

399
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,408
Sea settings protobuffers

400
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,528
Actually never really worked at protobuffers

401
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Protocol buffers

402
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm guessing it's what you mean right

403
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
Protocol buffers the Google Play

404
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:41,984
Someone start a collection to get that laptop fan replace

405
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,640
New battery in a CD drive

406
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,392
Give me a moment here

407
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:35,744
I'm going to have to login to my router and open

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
Portcullis computer

409
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
CD drives in broken for years

410
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Why is my Akira

411
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
Seriously why is Mighty wrong

412
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,904
That's me

413
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,328
Firewall

414
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
What 4 words

415
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,464
Does anyone from the internet want to see if they cannot connect in

416
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,128
Oh sweet that actually works you can ping home.st law.com

417
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,504

00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,048
554 what have I done

421
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
There we go

422
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
Ok

423
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
Yeah and see if it's or if it's dying to like it was last time for a lotto

424
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
That was sad

425
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
Turn on the lights

426
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448
I think I might try to do right now

427
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
Make a

428
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
Alive survive

429
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:04,896
Front end so I can feed data without actually being hooked up I guess

430
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,504
Ok

431
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
That's right now feeding data out

432
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,192
Just edit piraino just to get things moving calibrated see here

433
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,176
Saying anything

434
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,856
Are people still ok I can collect it works it works

435
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,208
Is there discord yes there is discord

436
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
I will

437
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,864
Yeah actually I can still hear certain links never expire

438
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
Person on the Earth

439
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
Ok

440
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
Yeah we had a power outage sorry

441
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
Everything's back up now

442
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,144
Vibe survive

443
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
Hey it's like everything is fine

444
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,248
Restart the data server

445
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,368
That was going to post a discord

446
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:59,072
Laptop laptop anymore it doesn't

447
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
Call

448
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
Server data server 9999

449
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Ok

450
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Looks pretty Spanky

451
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,720
Somebody has already connected in two people have connected

452
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:35,168
I think what I want to do right now just for the takeover

453
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Things here

454
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,432
Are Ben one thing you might have missed a little bit earlier as I do want to change the way this works I think I want to do a little bit more

455
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,552
Like what you guys are sending out in the second or third livestream where

456
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,952
I find a pose estimation thing based on the camera space information from the lighthouses and then

457
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,352
Used to determine the location of the lighthouses and other poses originally I wanted to be able to combine information

458
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
Lighthouses in name creates a single pose estimation but I don't think that will work very well

459
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
So I'm going to try doing a switching to this other one and it is probably more in line with what you and Alan have been

460
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,224
Before with on the pose estimation

461
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
Which I feel embarrassed that I'm doing things other be fair what happened was I thought I was smart

462
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,024
Going to do some clever way and it turns out the clever way was the dumb away and then I found out ok this is

463
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,608
Better way to do it you guys right whole time so

464
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
Ok are you guys getting dropped forcibly or you just disconnecting

465
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
Play Attack without above ground cables

466
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,312
On purpose I got disconnected ones still getting kicked

467
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,016
I know that would be there would be since I started back up

468
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:36,000
Calibrate quiet ok so in here

469
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,984
Well I should be able to do is just shut the date in through the default imu process and through the door

470
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,056
White process so I kind of wanna try that now

471
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,943
China's be the beginning of coming back

472
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
Timer for the data

473
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Yeah

474
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:05,951
Remember that actually works I think it does

475
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
Everybody get dropped all at once

476
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
I was weird

477
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:36,159
Can you just the first too many people connecting away there's somebody who's just spamming me

478
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,511
Who's 4666

479
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
Who is Dad

480
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
Hong Kong who are you

481
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:54,847
Somebody from the Netherlands from the Netherlands that is spending the server

482
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
Clearly Spelman

483
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,095
Whatever you guys are having fun I guess that's what matters

484
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
Oh you know why

485
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:40,671
In order to test so what am I

486
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:47,071
Try running another instance of Life survive so like this one's recording the data if I try

487
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,399
Playing it back it has to first connect to vinyl

488
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,751
Rape but I won't run for you because it won't we can connect device

489
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:00,383
We should probably fix there that's definitely something we have to fix sooner than later

490
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
What is an interconnected device

491
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,295
Because like you're right doesn't know what to do if it does

492
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,391
And that's totally about it should not have a problem with that

493
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,951
Lights to five should survive without

494
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
Kneeling next to the five

495
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:30,079
I'm thinking of pluggable sources thing is not getting more and more

496
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,479
Is there really sad that before you can do anything you find out you have to do like telling things and then to do any of those other

497
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
To do like a million other things

498
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Mrs check discord

499
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
Disconnect

500
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:03,103
I don't understand what am I supposed to be looking at them they're saying that

501
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
The address to connect to

502
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
Oh yeah

503
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
Do I have access to New

504
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
So that's going to be a little bit you know whatever was trying to hack it in real quick and see if we can get something

505
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
Headless

506
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839
See all that work

507
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,503
Data recorder

508
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
Expose

509
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
Surviving col

510
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,007
Can we make it so if we are in a headless mode we don't do anything stupid

511
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,079
Like trying to hold a USB

512
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,023
Hey sweet ok

513
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:38,655
How is a lot easier than I thought it would be we didn't have to go code an entire subsystem

514
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
Ok so what that means is this code just runs on a little spin loop all the time

515
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,871
So I should

516
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
Tabs

517
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:04,511
Why in the world would that be defaulted on

518
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,071
Ok so

519
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
Debtline

520
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:15,007
Play I'm jet wind what is that syntax

521
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,751
Are cats tbnr number

522
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:02,111
Actually so you know I gotta get your thing

523
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,119
Rayburn saying I want to get up your arm

524
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
What's your IP

525
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
Ok

526
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
Scanner

527
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,607
What's better than il2 somebody else's code that shows you how they did

528
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
Washing the chat for me

529
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:12,511
Yeah yeah now I can read the data

530
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Paranoid

531
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
I can't hear it

532
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,663
What happens if you put it on something fabric

533
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,911
The one two

534
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:57,311
So

535
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,151
First character

536
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
Yeah it might have been reverberating to the table because it feels like I felt like

537
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Feeling in my arms when you are running it that way so

538
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:26,751
Stay here

539
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:58,751
Light data

540
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:05,151
Just trying to sell his studying

541
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:11,551
A scanner line

542
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:25,631
Is this the right number 12345

543
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:07,871
Will this work with Sam

544
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
Calibration also yes that's right now

545
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,671
Turn into the calibrator

546
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:27,071
Yes that is the goal so this works like as I expect I should be able to tutor

547
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
Tell the difference

548
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,871
Timestamp a code

549
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:49,087
BA code x a code

550
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:55,487
ID sweep

551
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:01,887
IKEA

552
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:20,831
Think that's the right thing

553
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,631
House can be a little tricky

554
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,847
Think that's the right

555
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:53,247
Use for everything

556
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,807
Headset and white man

557
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:22,687
Putting the data recorder

558
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,087
Goes

559
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,999
That's all

560
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:02,111
Do skills horribly wrong like I'm noodling the data in the

561
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,439
Place it's just

562
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,839
Just wrong well I might just typing the data from the serial terminal into the function call but I would not

563
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:18,239
And I guess that makes sense

564
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,383
Hopefully

565
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:41,023
The first one is timecode

566
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:47,423
I don't think so cos I'm going to be the only already be processed by the

567
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,823
Most two figured out what the type deltatime should be this is after does the December duration stop

568
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,175
So it like it knows like this is when in the sweep and happened so

569
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:04,575
Why am I blanking on the mile

570
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,183
Santa idea which one is centrally this

571
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,999
After timecode

572
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:19,679
You know what a reasonable names

573
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:30,687
A code

574
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
Ok that gonna work that is totally Alan

575
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,471
Wait is that

576
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:39,039
Yeah is that I've only ever had

577
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:45,439
I would like there's just world

578
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:51,839
Well let's see if you come

579
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:58,239
A solution in then I'll get this committed and you guys can go have fun with this or something

580
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:02,847
Can you tell me if it's constantly crashing on you

581
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,431
No it died

582
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,247
Pilot crash

583
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,183
That was weird

584
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,511
I know why crashed

585
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,911
Cos it doesn't know where the points are for the headset because it can connect the head

586
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:35,103
We should probably also stored below the point locations in the config-file somewhere

587
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,431
Down

588
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:47,903
Is it going patience

589
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:06,079
Whatever it's worth committing now

590
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:20,575
Trash how to write

591
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
Ok do you want to see if you can find it off network wise

592
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:36,447
Ok so this is my cock you survive here

593
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,055
Give me a minute

594
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,759
When did I just use Nana

595
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:57,951
I just use illicit seriously now

596
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
Oh yeah yeah yeah that's true so I have your screen off

597
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,751
Holloway everything inside this fox is visible to the world

598
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:17,151
So I just artificial I drew it yeah you can go play out there now

599
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:23,551
And see what you're doing are you to be calling and then

600
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:29,951
I'll give you my IP

601
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:38,399
I don't know what my IP11 254 but I don't know why I don't know

602
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
9999

603
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,943
Sweet potato

604
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:03,231
Turn on my starting

605
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,303
Clientele from yeah

606
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,703
Cal underscore choir

607
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
I do not have device connected to my machine

608
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:25,503
The network

609
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,063
Latency

610
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,263
Does not what I would have expected to just work but there is interesting

611
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,663
Does give us another reason to distort the the point locations of

612
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,783
In the config files that's going to be a pain

613
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,183
Yeah cos as soon as I get to the final calibration step it's like I need to know where the points are in and it just crashes

614
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:15,423
No hello site no I do have a bit of an sp30

615
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,495
Private garden playing with

616
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,615
See if I can show that

617
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,215
Network

618
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,711
Carragher

619
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,951
My car's coolant cap without dinner

620
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
On

621
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:18,143
Hey I'm actually I doing a live stream right now can I call you back and I'm guessing an hour's

622
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:24,543
Short live stream

623
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,431
I would like to go out with

624
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:36,319
You're ok he said he's up for it

625
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:42,719
Yeah 2-hours he said yeah we be funny done by then

626
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:51,167
MC hear you see my camera is just hose

627
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
Hey there we go ok

628
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:20,095
Settle I have actually been playing with the esp32 as

629
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
Come on

630
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,503
Whatever

631
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
China's I've been playing with esp32

632
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,463
Pretty premium so far just little things here and there and I take

633
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,863
Play am now able to print circuit boards at home down 2.4 mbsc discount

634
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:08,991
Oh another thing that we did with the HTC vive stuff so

635
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,415
So before there is a thing we were completely tied to the fort

636
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:22,815
Tn25 itself used on but the problem is that there's really no good source for 48 mHz

637
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:29,215
Turn the ESP so for on collecting just regular data that was not going to fly

638
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:34,591
So loud survive does now actually have on

639
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,991
Configurable time basis so this has to do with the disability waiter the VAT is that all

640
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:47,391
These will be provided to whatever speed you actually want to operate at so right I'm in media

641
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,695
Please realise it has

642
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,071
What's going on

643
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:08,639
Cheap recommend

644
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:15,039
Is asking for PCB printing

645
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:21,439
Can you use a pendulum p2502 w

646
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:25,535
A super cheap

647
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:31,935
I'll pull up and I will show you guys just how ridiculous

648
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Play cheap

649
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:39,103
Is my internet not working now

650
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:44,735
I'm streaming they're alright

651
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:51,135
Yes yeah I think it's

652
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,263
Am I streaming now

653
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:23,647
I think the internet here dropped out ok

654
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:32,095
No I'm definitely here is still here we don't have a power outage and I know where that was

655
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:46,175
Add this printer right here

656
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:52,575
When I bought it was 3699 3799 new and came with the

657
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:58,975
3 decent size cartridge and I bought another cartridge for it they're really cheap

658
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Really nice

659
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:06,655
There are plenty fine for PCB printing normally I have to double up

660
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:10,495
He doesn't have enough turn aside to like

661
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:16,895
Double up transparencies stack them but it's fine

662
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
I now switched out my LED process my process for exposure to an LED

663
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:29,695
That was going to slow me down but it turns out it exposes in about 4 seconds so that's not an issue anymore

664
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:39,423
I'm leaving now to do now

665
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,823
So cold is right now for the most part

666
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
Going to be working on getting a I really want to do ESP tags to begin with

667
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:58,623
And after that I can go to switch off to whatever but I do want to do

668
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:05,023
Want to try to get life survive running on an esp32 so I can create kind of in a r

669
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:11,423
Environment where it'll be like a little screen that you can hold up in like look through and see

670
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
Around and be able to do that very very inexpensively I think there's some really things you can do with that

671
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,223
But the first part of all of that has to do with fencing on the ESB with you thinking I do with the esp8285

672
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,623
And be able to do it that way with that does not directly involved like survive

673
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:36,255
Dune Buggy asked like super stripped-down so I think that would be fun

674
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:42,655
Oh no not really have anything else to go over right now

675
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:48,543
Add some data running we can kind of processor

676
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,991
Yeah

677
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:03,391
4 seconds 4 seconds

678
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:09,535
You have a video of their just couldn't look so ridiculous it's done

679
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,911
Ok I don't know

680
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:21,311
Not really I feel like the only working when we doing is to do some of the more plausible stuff with

681
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:27,711
Divide really rather not do that on livestream I think that would detract from it

682
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:34,367
Yeah actually so I should have clarified that with the yes peas on the what I want to do with them

683
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:40,767
Is it going to be using the wrong packets from the ESP so you don't have to have all of this overhead

684
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:47,167
Connecting up in staying connected instead it'll just transmitter Warframe whenever it's easily white horse

685
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:53,567
Immediately just send it and then I'm a computer and it'll have at least two probably

686
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:59,967
Real text just sitting in passive mode listening and whenever a message comes

687
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:06,367
ESP it just goes in processes that right then and there that way you don't have to worry about staying

688
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:12,767
Connected you don't have to worry about the added latency of a wireless network and stuff like that it's it's

689
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:19,167
Stream Lilo latency when you use the red packets cell that works out pretty well

690
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,127
Are we have anything else to you

691
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,431
Ok

692
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:36,831
Yeah yesterday 32 well 3.5 is 10

693
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:43,231
Without spending amount and I'm shipping yeah esp32 is a lot more

694
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
You cannot get a lot more easily you can also just buy the sky for you too

695
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,775
For me at 5 of them for £14.99

696
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
Yep yep

697
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,975
Sorry I guess most is anything else based on what we had said you were going to do or later on in the Stream

698
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,815
Probably just going to go call it quits

699
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:28,287
Thanks everybody for coming out I will have to find a year going over different things

700
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:32,895
Difficult to get work done right now if anyone phase of it

701
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,687
Alarm

702
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:43,647
I don't have a colour laser printer

703
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,999
No that's Josh Allen

704
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:59,263
Thanks everybody for coming out this could be a real quick thing

705
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:07,711
What we still haven't gotten adarshi by Lady to sell him to me

706
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:14,111
Sometimes getting things from people in China's a lot more difficult than you'd expect

707
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,671
Ok bye everybody
