1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Everybody

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:08,448
I went to ifo with the with the with unity Technologies a couple weeks

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
Go like right before Thanksgiving and

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
Friend of mine gray cotton

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:20,480
He had an HTC Vive and I played with oculus app raided the gear VR play with a bunch of these things and

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,576
K cool but I never played an HTC Vive and as soon as he got it out

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
As soon as he showed me those like boxes

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,976
I realized htc-vive is where the future of VR is

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,560
I feel really bad that I'm like a year behind the times now but

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
It just totally blew my mind when I was able to play space pirate trainer and it just work now is the coolest thing

11
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
The fact that

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,360
This thing knows where it is in 3D space is just so cool and

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408
But I think it's also really cool is

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
The way in which it knows where it is and that's one of the things I just decided as soon as I get my hands on this thing

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
By the way I didn't actually buy all of big thanks to Unity Technologies for financing most of the purchase

16
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
This product for

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
For myhabit hacking fun

18
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
But I

19
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
I wanted to be able to hack this be able to find out where was and all the other details in a way that was

20
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Actually open source

21
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
And there are some projects but they're under the lgpl and they're

22
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
You're not quite there either so that's that one of the big things that the name

23
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
He realize I wanted to do a lot of packing was there are some other project like

24
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
Libre osvr Vive

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,168
But the problem was this project to do it it's not

26
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:49,312
It's not ready or not that Fuller complete or anyting

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
I started trying to actually get it and trying to get all of the libraries that were necessary for the osvr implementation

28
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,064
And everything else and they needed eigen and opencv and

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,672
All of this stuff and I actually ran out of data on my cell phone plan

30
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
And I decided this is just ridiculous

31
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
Somebody needs to write an HTC Vive thing that is a reasonable size will be very fast

32
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,984
Hospital

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
I got it out requires V

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,712
VR capable computer I realized

35
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
They haven't met me have the wires they wouldn't cuz I'm not really famous or anything but that's okay because I'm going to

36
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
If I can get this htc-vive running over the next couple months on this right

37
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
I hear my old little touchy-feely Intel i5 gen 1 laptop

38
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,056
Okay

39
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
And it totally does not have a TV that you be able to handle it but I don't know I'll just see what happens when

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Whatever I'm not

41
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
I don't need fast computers to see if it's going to work

42
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
There have been a lot of progress in these these these different tools people have been reverse engineering it more and more

43
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Implementations on Lenox and stuff like that

44
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
So like this Heroes VR Vive Libre

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
Call the vibe I kept pronouncing it.

46
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
And Viv and all that I don't know why I just thought it was funny so

47
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
No it's a mine

48
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,320
Thanks Greg for for fixing that my mind

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Any rate these tools that people have been copying off each other for a while have

50
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,072
Various levels of completion but none of them are really all that.

51
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
Really this is a matter of being on like I'm like a little midget on the giant Justin shoulders

52
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Because other people have already gone through a great deal of effort figuring out exactly what all of these messages

53
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
At the very least how to get them so for instance here under the lighthouse redox

54
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Project under

55
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,392
Neural neural something like that

56
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
They have done a lot of reverse engineering on the USB protocol so what the basic

57
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,423
Machines are basic endpoints are devices

58
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
So

59
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,871
Lsusd I can see a bunch of these devices from the HTC Vive

60
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,247
They've kind of documented what they were and what kind of devices to stay attached as

61
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
So there's a bunch of different properties you can get this thing

62
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
Hear Hoops wrong window know what you're going over to the other desktop

63
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Cuz I don't meet you

64
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
So

65
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,775
Hope you're going to go over together desktop to

66
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
This right here so this is the hmd or I don't even know what the other names for Dar but this

67
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Sing right here has a bunch of documented commands that you can receive from an information about the lens separation

68
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
Whether or not this button right here is pressed and whether or not there's a person who's like moving their face

69
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Closer or farther face proximity it says how close their faces this live

70
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Center

71
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
Right in there

72
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
Actually you can kind of see it flashing a little bit I guess

73
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
What's interesting that means that the camera here can actually see a little bit of infrared

74
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
I can't quite see the white house so I can't really show you guys

75
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
The lighthouse data

76
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
Erase this thing's got all these sensors on it and all of that and

77
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
Acted by USB to my laptop here

78
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
Headset connected through cable

79
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
My laptop over including all of

80
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
The the light sensors

81
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
I guess I should also spend a minute explaining how this whole thing works and why I thought it was so cool so for doing

82
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
Room scale kind of telling where you are that's a really really hard problem and you think that you know since 19

83
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,775
Figure out a solvent good

84
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,663
Dave Chapman

85
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
David somebody who's working on some of the other parts of this affect the project

86
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
So trying to reverse-engineer this last little bit that I'm kind of run into and he's also going to be working on trying to

87
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
To do the mathematics use the common filters to figure out based on the IMU updates of the devices

88
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
Where they are in 3D space

89
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
I also using the system I'm about to go and explain how it works so the reason

90
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,479
That the the HTC Vive is so

91
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
Amazing is because the way in which it tells where everything is so

92
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,719
It has these lighthouses that Lighthouse up there

93
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:32,863
And I want across the room and barely see it over there

94
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
For specifically coded. Of time and they sweep a laser this way

95
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
Bellator this way and then the other one flashes its lights weeps flashes its lights flashing

96
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
The same in between each time

97
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,695
And depending on the amount of time it was between the Flash

98
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
And when you see that light sweep passed you that's how you know where you are in this axis Felton

99
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
To the lighthouse and how you know where you are in this axis relative to the lighthouse

100
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,895
Give me a second here I'm going to go pull up a video I recorded

101
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm probably going to turn into video

102
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,159
Plugging it in here

103
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Define dit

104
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
But you know what

105
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
Hard time keeping up so I took a video

106
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,279
Admitting light this is with an infrared camera

107
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,167
And I used rolling shutter in order to get a better picture as to what's going on

108
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
What happens if there's this field of LEDs visible right here that goes

109
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,967
Goes and does The Flash and these two wheels there and there with your spinning around in a meeting

110
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
The beam of light what go and paint the scene

111
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
So to speak

112
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
I guess why they call them lighthouses cuz they really do like and each one

113
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
The little sisters on the Vive

114
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Can pick up exactly when the face

115
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Exactly where it is and the other thing that makes it super cool is it means that you can have a bunch of these devices

116
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
They don't make it harder for you to figure out where they all are which is just completely mind-boggling because that's like one of the hugest problem

117
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
I never thought I had never heard of this technology it was amazing I have to start playing with it

118
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
By the way I'm also playing with the esp32 so

119
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
You'll have to wait to see if I actually get far enough to figure out how to make them thicker related

120
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
So David over there and Dave has been working

121
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
Level

122
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:39,487
First though so back into what I'm actually here to do today it's kind of now the intro video

123
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
I want to know what time the lights Weeps By each one of them

124
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Have the other one I want to know what time the lights we spy

125
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
Each one of the sensors on this thing right here so each one of these little dots has little photo center

126
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
And there is a processor onboard that operates at 48 make undershirt actually operated much higher but they will

127
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
Tell you that within 148 millionth of a second when that being came and hit each one of those little dots

128
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
And I want to be able to get that data back now for the headset

129
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
That's really easy that's actually already documented and it's documented really really well

130
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:31,711
Somewhere here like how

131
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
I am U button controller

132
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Wireless dongle

133
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Oh where is it it's somewhere here

134
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
I'm looking I'm looking

135
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
Maybe it wasn't documented here all that well

136
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Hmd display

137
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,479
How cool H&D Brendan says hmd may stand for head-mounted display I didn't know that

138
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:10,623
What are you guys still watching the chat so I don't okay

139
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,743
So if something comes up tell me that I should stop

140
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Now that's not useful

141
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
Okay you know what actually I don't maybe they don't documented maybe that was under the

142
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
Osvr Vive here

143
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
I can find a different file that they were looking at here it is

144
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
VL hid reports.

145
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
They have the head-to-head Mount display structures and they tell me what everything is I can file

146
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Find the right one

147
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
Give me a second to find it

148
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,807
Not yet

149
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,463
Oh okay

150
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
But that's not the point the point where yes

151
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Make that clear

152
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
Answer that more clearly okay I will do that after this next section. You guys

153
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
I don't have a question about why and I'll get into that this is actually the right that

154
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
The right one

155
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
Whenever the light passes by or Flash hits it I get information when did that flash happen and

156
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
And how long was the Flash and it tells me which sensor on the amount pet gnosis play

157
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
It was that actually received the Flash

158
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
On the head-mounted display that actually received the Flash and so using the structure I can then parse back and get it

159
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Information about what all is actually going on, the problem is with this

160
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
This guy this is not any word near fat

161
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
Has all sorts of crazy crazy different protocol from any other part of the system

162
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
Tattoos in Wireless mode

163
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
The way with parse was just not not quite there so I started to really dig at that

164
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
Almond so introduce my project

165
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
Live survive so that people with lower end Hardware specifically

166
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
So I can survive on my cell phone data plan and be able to get the stuff I need without having

167
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Any rate

168
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
To check that out and in here I'm actually starting on everything so under the source Direct

169
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,087
After 8 I have survived USB type-c

170
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
So I do note that this is basically a blatant rip-off of everybody else's previous work button

171
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
Because of other reasons in constrained I do have to get it written under the mitx

172
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
11 license so that is what license is going to be under as I have to rewrite portions which I have written

173
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
From the ground-up I may have to specifically right portions in order to maintain that

174
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,783
So you guys are curious why

175
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
And and I do want to clarify so it does have to do with with the

176
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
Speed and I do believe that the architecture that everybody's using right now which involves

177
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
Enormous

178
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
The interaction between the hardware to the server to the different pieces of software that

179
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
Environment for the virtual reality World in which you're going to be playing is entirely too complicated for

180
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
And

181
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:31,487
I see that those from software point of view because I like to really get into the nuts-and-bolts I would rather

182
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
V that have a working product and I know that seems

183
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Dumb but that's its decide might have been able to look at something and see all of the parts but

184
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:46,335
Because those parts are really big the fact that I needed a copy of eigg in

185
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
Decompiled like this and they're not even doing calming filters as far as I can tell in any of the open-source libraries

186
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
That was that was pretty painful I mean I kind of big and all of the other pack

187
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463
Packages that are necessary to operate these and

188
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
Hair stuck in object-oriented Haitian land of just

189
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
Mountains mountains of abstractions in classes and everything and I'm I'm seguy I want to be able to work with

190
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
More concrete objects in concrete

191
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
Like simple code that's really kind of my driving Factor behind this I don't want

192
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,295
Going to have client-server relationships and all this other stuff which I'm going to have a limited amount probably

193
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
But not for the core environment I want to be able to have a library that you can use and be able to just get the position of all

194
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
All of these objects

195
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,559
And maybe I'll have a companion library at some point

196
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,959
Maybe this is all time this guy I've no idea whenever I see going to do any of this stuff but where it would simplify its

197
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,055
Just be a library you include and you can just start writing opengl code

198
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
And that's that's where I want to be that's what I want to have I don't want to mess with these levels beefed-up possum instantiate in all the

199
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,039
I just want a really basic Library

200
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,439
It doesn't use very much room and very few dependencies like a right now we're looking at using the potty

201
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
Person that transforms which is a pretty small Library we might not even be using that I'm right now I think I'm using zlide

202
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
And live USB and pthread switch

203
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,031
Come on most Linux distributions and even if live USB doesn't it's only like a megabyte

204
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,383
I hope that answers everything Brandon his chatton

205
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Going pretty good

206
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,295
Okay by the way I got to inverse phase over there

207
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
He has been sick the last couple of days but he's he's feeling better today that's good

208
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
So David Chapman's over there he's been helping out like look at the protocol and all that

209
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
And Dom and really the last thing that I didn't know how to do it all so when I saw Pro

210
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
Problems I want to make sure that I can get the problem whatever it is from this huge nebulous

211
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
Whatever into something that I can put into a box and something that I know I can control the inputs in the output

212
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
And

213
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,231
Everybody else who's been working on these projects has done an amazing job at making that possible

214
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Be able to get it somewhere that I can have it

215
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:20,191
But still this thing is the last Bastion so until I can figure out where this thing is flights are I can't even

216
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Begin to figure out

217
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:28,639
Like where it is cuz I can't decode the light coming past it

218
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
So what I can do right now

219
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Power off this guy

220
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,255
And I'm going to go run a copy of

221
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,839
Also stickers on the Waterworks bass get rid of it

222
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,959
I can still build it

223
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Okay

224
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
So

225
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,391
Whenever I have a message that comes in from something I don't know what is

226
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
It will display their so I can power this thing on

227
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,071
And right now there's no messages

228
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,191
But what I can do

229
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:29,823
Dwyane Wade normally try to solve these problems with this is I try to control it so

230
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,431
I was able to decode all of the buttons and all of that next week

231
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,759
Python print statement so you guys can see what that looks like

232
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
Five data so let's just first look

233
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
At the IMU information

234
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
And see what that looks like

235
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:05,407
Okay so you can see here the IMU data so the IMU inside

236
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
This guy is based off of a an accelerometer and it has an extra

237
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
Hawaii and Izzy bizu XYZ

238
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
And a gyro here here in here so if I rotate the thing so it's

239
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
So like this is negative

240
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
Negative X orientation down and they can see -4000 about 4090

241
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
In the First Column if I do it this way

242
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
It's about positive 4096 in the First Column and then if I do it this way

243
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Way

244
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
You can see that it's about 4000 second column

245
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Cameron diaz

246
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,048
Somewhere here there this way is he down

247
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,888
And then you have the gyro which can tell you

248
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Rotating around that axis for this access or you know whatever axies whatever

249
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
Videos that use the siren accelerometer in between frames for sweet

250
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
Exactly where you are in a really fast rate that's how you actually can make

251
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Can be tracking you in real-time so let's stop looking at that for a moment

252
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:29,888
And let's actually just just for the sake of you guys getting a feel for it

253
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
I do need to push some updates I had a bit of a sour attitude with

254
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
This last night I feel bad for the lighthouse redox people open up a ticket and was a little dress

255
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,552
Castrated sorry I didn't mean to bite you guys anyway

256
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
And I kind of

257
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
Yeah I shouldn't said that there's a lot of issues with the doc's not know the doctor really good thank you so

258
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
Come back here there are there different kinds of commands that can come back from this thing, they're all pass through

259
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
The same data buffer and commands can contain things like the buttons or the axies

260
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Likely either trigger Axis or the touch access for right now just so you guys can

261
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
I'm not totally kidding you I'm going to just print out the analog access whenever it gets

262
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,864
Stride you can't see if I knew that the analog access whenever I update it

263
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,264
Picotte always on top

264
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
So I'm not going to print that out whenever whenever gets updated

265
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
So now

266
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,024
Hold on I've got to be

267
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
On the bug

268
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
So now this this trigger right here is I pull it Tighter and Tighter it goes up higher and higher

269
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
So now by looking at this particular command I can see what it's values are if I

270
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
Look at a different command like if I print out when I receive something in the the other message

271
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
Then whenever I touch the touchpad right here

272
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,936
You can see that it update so that's a very negative

273
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,568
X and Y so actually seeing both

274
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,064
So now if I go over there it's 32,000 there's 31

275
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
32

276
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
Negative positive

277
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,608
That's what those numbers mean I do think that there are a lot of

278
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:15,008
Are these values that nobody really figured out how to parse before it has to do with the way in which these B flags were used

279
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
Everly

280
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,224
What does somebody want to know

281
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,344
Flags me go print that out right now

282
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,744
Trigger

283
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,144
I'm going to print out whenever the button mask gets altered

284
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
Sue

285
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,760
So now analog trigger but watching I get it really close

286
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,624
When I get it on there it sets the trigger for button mask one

287
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
I like to go sit back 20

288
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,072
So when I click it it's what mask one and they use but math for this so that if I like touch this

289
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
Like to touch it

290
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,936
It's too if I press hard it sets the button mask for 4

291
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,776
4 + 2 is 6 so if I touch it and

292
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Click

293
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,944
Little bit more

294
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
I'm so that's how that works there's also this up here

295
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Kiss me a butt mask of

296
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
20 hack

297
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,072
The steam button is 08 hacks

298
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,936
There's the funky thing on the side here that's 10 hacks

299
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,824
Maybe there's another button here that I don't know about I keep finding things I didn't

300
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
No Justin

301
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,760
There's any other questions feel free to just say to the chat there's enough people around here watching it that will

302
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Alert me to it

303
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,208
Really big window

304
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,328
People are

305
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
Probably or something oh

306
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:33,760
Okay well I could but it's it's difficult for me to

307
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,160
People around here telling me what the hell you guys are talking about and chat first of all

308
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
Get back real quick for the the lightweight portion

309
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,376
By writing everything in see now

310
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,984
It makes it so that you can then use it in more situations

311
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
Much more easily where is when you start off with something it's already designed be heavyweight then you might run

312
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,480
Situations where it's not a viable option

313
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,808
And I've run is that a lot

314
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
So because you know what I did my Minecraft on an AVR slide and absolute minimum

315
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:19,328
Porting at any other system was instantaneous very easy basic C code

316
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
Very tightly written

317
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
Works everywhere I kind of want that for this

318
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
What did you say

319
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
Maybe

320
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
Laptop not be

321
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,440
Okay hold on let me switch that out then

322
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,120
Explanation of

323
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
What happens when you start with C + +

324
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
How see if it's still

325
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,712
Now

326
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Okay

327
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
Okay tell you what I'll do I'll shrink this even smaller and then

328
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
Hey it's really small okay yeah this is a pretty slow laptop so that's one of the reasons

329
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,032
Everything good okay

330
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
Can you see all of the little

331
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,128
Right here

332
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Is it still visible

333
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:44,320
Like you as a person camera and slide of the

334
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:51,744
Okay good good got it

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,328
Back to the CC plus plus thing

336
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
So the way when I do my engineering if I can and I have the time and I have the wherewithal I was

337
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
I want to make everything that I work on as small as possible as tight as possible so that I can be used elsewhere

338
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
Absolutely crazy that I would want to plan for this project to be small and lightweight besides the obvious this is a slow computer

339
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
Peter and I want to shave off every possible microsecond I can be able to spend those microseconds on other things

340
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,488
Like rendering

341
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
I do have some longer-term plans for this project

342
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
But those are just pie-in-the-sky plans so I'll just leave that there

343
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
I really like the just a personal thing

344
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
All of the dependencies the actual reason they got me doing this instead of using one

345
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
Existing systems was because I ran out of data on my cell phone plan trying to get all of the

346
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:59,328
Dependencies of the project for what I needed so this is Tiny that's the way I'm going

347
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:11,872
No no ASCII okay

348
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
Moving on so we had the button masks those worked out

349
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:24,672
Happy scoot this one over the other workspace to mask the wrong controller

350
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
Going all is well

351
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
And so I was able to finally get all that figured out I found out some other information about the masks in the way that they were working

352
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
In all that I do need to go update those project moving on now

353
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
I'm going to go comment out those print statements and I'm going to get to the Crux of what I

354
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,696
Got to make that always on top now going to get to the Crux of what I want to do today

355
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,512
I don't know if I'm going to able to do it but it's my goal

356
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
So I can decode everything that I really need right now I don't actually decode all

357
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
Old Lighthouse data but I don't think I need it for what I'm working on all of the lights

358
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
To come and get the headset but the one thing I can't do and I can't do it as of right now so you guys forgot

359
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
Just give it a shot and see if I can make it happen cuz I can't read the light data from the I cried I spent quite a while

360
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:32,512
I've been complaining to people online I tweeted a little bit earlier today

361
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:43,520
Symcode these right here which looks like nobody took to trying to see

362
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
Figure out what it was of what I'm getting back how weird

363
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,320
This is a closed off some of these extra tabs

364
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
So if

365
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
Now

366
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,144
I have down here I'm going to display anytime data comes in for this thing that I do

367
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,520
Don't know what it is then I'm going to display a message I'm going to display a little bit of text

368
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:22,176
So Mandy right now is going to turn on the two lighthouses and we'll see

369
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,216
Nothing started freaking out yet

370
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
Lighthouses are coming online

371
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
They're online and there's the data complete craziness this is totally

372
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
Crazy this thing right here is receiving data from the lighthouses I'm just playing to the screen I have no idea

373
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:10,816
What any of that mean I spent hours and hours and hours and hours hours okay what like 10 hours

374
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
Pouring over it and and I got nowhere

375
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
So let's take a look at what some of this looks like and I'll explain to you guys how I started playing with it and

376
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,224
Shrink the font hear some and

377
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,856
Why it's so hard

378
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
The most data whenever you're playing with it when you look at their the date of reverse engineering it

379
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,888
You'll start to look for patterns so if I instead of printing this

380
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,496
I just print all data that's coming in

381
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,176
Chanel

382
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
What turn the phone off

383
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
Nice enough to take this controller and put tape over it over everyone of the

384
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
Surfaces so that it it won't receive any when I power it on since it's not receiving light

385
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Like data I can look at this and someone asks you how like you can do basic reverse engineering with this sort of thing right now

386
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:30,176
I'm streaming through data coming from it and if I click something you'll notice that the code right here

387
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:36,576
Changes who's I change the analog values that changes so when I change something I speeded the B chain

388
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,976
I know that it had something to do with that end in the same thing for this overtime this

389
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:49,376
Number here is incrementing and this number here is somewhere else here is incrementing overtime

390
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,776
And being able to kind of see these patterns helps you have an idea as to what's going on Princeton Simon

391
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:08,576
Well when I hold it like this this column right here reads f-zero but when I do like

392
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Sbcounty read 0f that's kind of interesting and they would look at

393
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Just call him over and they'd find out there's correlation they're here look at that there's correlation and by looking at

394
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,776
Those fields you can kind of figure out how they get used and how each part of that like goes to

395
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
Picture has

396
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
Question

397
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:42,112
Okay then if you

398
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:48,512
If you want to help out here

399
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
I'm not really sure of a good way of communicating while I'm live streaming I don't have a s desktop but

400
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
There are people here that if you want to go like startup Ascot Elsewhere on the email or something to be really cool

401
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,712
Any rate let's go and look at the light data

402
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
I'm done right now are all supposed to cover all of the sensors are covered

403
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
Do all of that was just the raw data right now because all of the centers are covered

404
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
I thought it didn't update or whenever Hamilton takes recovered do I change the code so that it would dump

405
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
All the data that comes in now it's only dumping date of the screen but it doesn't know what to do with

406
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,200
So if I go expose this I right here see that

407
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,832
New data open the I now there's tons of data so

408
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:51,232
This like data is a little bit harder to figure out what is because instead of it fitting into some sort of nice

409
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
My smol like all of the other data well the lines are different lengths but you can see sometimes too

410
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
But the lines are this long and sometimes their lifelong

411
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
Now there's no B there if I change the orientation. There's more B there so we're clearly

412
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
Was it clearly cuz I don't know or really dealing with but it looks like we're dealing with something where these records aren't of stable size

413
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
Now there's a little bit of an annoyance in it because the data coming from the all the lighthouses is

414
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
Complicated there's the long Paul and there's the streak

415
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
Comes by so one thing I tried doing last night was jiggering up the

416
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Little law

417
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
Aviall right here with a little LED on it and black

418
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:48,320
Homelite in pattern that I would be able to see

419
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
Concerning I don't know why it's not lit right now

420
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:15,200
OK Google still working

421
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,600
So what I'm going to do right now is instead of having a situation where I can't control tool

422
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:28,000
Life is going into the controller because it's coming from the lighthouse over there and up there I'm going to go with her

423
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
And then we're going to use Blissful aviar right here in order to actually light up the

424
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:40,800
Different sensors on this controller

425
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Steamvr Depot

426
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Can he post a link that publicly

427
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:01,280
Can you pull up for me

428
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:07,680
What will start reverse engineering this stop and just somebody just you know

429
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,312
Early it anyway I'm going to turn this controller off

430
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,384
And this one on

431
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
And now I'm going to use this I'm going to hold it up to the little light right here

432
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,440
So now when I hold it up I can actually see data that is predictable

433
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,024
So now I can control my source

434
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,376
And I can control properties about the source and see how that changes the output

435
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,264
Now I will say that I currently do not know

436
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
What's really going on here, as far as what these b mean but until somebody else

437
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
Start digging through this

438
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
I don't know

439
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,344
Brandon are you on the trail of trying to get the info

440
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,584
Well we have our our people here working on it right now to see if this entire video

441
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
We will see

442
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
Working on the problem inside here though I have an EGR codes

443
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,784
ER that's running on the floorboard right here and I'm going to edit test. See

444
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,184
By the way as soon as the people who worked on the documentation for this for like of course it's not going to

445
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,584
Lightened up in Plano

446
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
Wizards for killing that

447
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
I have a VR code and what I do is I turn the LED on

448
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
That takes two cycles I subtract one from marker which I believe is a registered this point I'm sets one psycho

449
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
Can I turn the port back off and I have a while to go back up which I just now read

450
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,415
Realize it is less than 2 MHz I should probably

451
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
Optical

452
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
Value

453
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
Call make it work better

454
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:18,495
Chelsea

455
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:22,591
1843

456
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:27,711
They actually know that that's the case

457
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
Heart

458
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
Said that the person who wrote The Firm or for This Guy's in the chat room so if you want to just like string me along a little bit little bit

459
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,679
Not too much would be kind of fun but

460
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:54,079
Yeah okay

461
00:42:54,335 --> 00:43:00,479
Whatever let's start messing around with this

462
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,879
So that would be zero a that's still a little hot so it is actually 1.8 MHz

463
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:11,999
By the way do you mind if I, the stuff publicly like

464
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:18,399
This is going to be about 1.8 megahertz turns out

465
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,799
That's probably better than the two megahertz suggestion from the lighthouse

466
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Redox people

467
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:35,039
Any rate you can see that now when I take this light right here and I hold it up close to the the thing

468
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,367
Boom after getting the data all is fine and well

469
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:44,767
Some of the more important things now though is the data doesn't look completely random anymore I'm starting to get a little

470
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
More

471
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:52,191
Information about what's going on you can see that the first value is 0 x 5

472
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
50

473
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
The second I use A1

474
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,591
Select a different light like this one right here sensor

475
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
For this one

476
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:06,271
This one this one this one any of these you can see that now I can tell which led or which photodiode it is that is

477
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
Being hooked up to

478
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,623
So what's going on

479
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,791
So now I'm going to try to make it longer

480
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,887
Instead of only being on and off for five Cycles which is

481
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,823
908 55 1.8

482
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615
X

483
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
48 MHz

484
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,711
133

485
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
Where's

486
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
Should I switch to programming mode

487
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Cono

488
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
Out here is

489
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,079
233

490
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,895
About 85 so I don't know why that's so

491
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:12,063
Says a one so maybe a one is actually not what I think it is but what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it turn on for a little

492
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,647
Bit longer so one extra cycle on off on off on off

493
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:21,791
One extra one I'm so to take slightly longer and I'm going to reburn the firmware

494
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
So now 3 burning

495
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,935
When I go back over here

496
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,751
Hold it up to the light

497
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,055
Now it says ba

498
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
Remember okay

499
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
Well I guess I'll make a little chart

500
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
Exercise Gerlach's

501
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,695
B3 before something like that

502
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
25

503
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,935
Five says oops

504
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,055
A1 A2

505
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Hue

506
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
But the other thing is

507
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,711
One of the things that kind of funny about this

508
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
When the light brighter light the actual length of the pulse is

509
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,927
Is increased because

510
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:27,327
I don't know how Works internally I'm probably wrong and making a fool of myself but the signal from the analog circuitry is going to be going

511
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,655
Edgar pasta threshold earlier and leave it later

512
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,959
If the amplitude of the signal is higher

513
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,799
Today. I'm going to hold it to yourself to say it's about A9

514
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
Length of time

515
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:49,087
For everybody who doesn't know these are just hexadecimal values

516
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:54,719
They're they're just easier to use in programming more frequently cuz I can say like a

517
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,559
Represents the number 165

518
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,631
And it's easier to see in base

519
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:08,031
Like the 8-Bit B that we have cuz everything fits into two digits so that's why I use hacks

520
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:13,151
A lot plus try seven and see what 7 says

521
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
7

522
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
B1

523
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,551
C 0

524
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Striate

525
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,863
Anything I need to know from the shop

526
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,471
Washing quick where you create him

527
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
Quick Square

528
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,967
Quey swarey quick Square

529
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:52,831
Please don't dmca me or something

530
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Steve what you're not doing anything with so

531
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,231
Well I mean technically it's their Hardware so

532
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:06,655
Although I think I do remember how the DMC work for this I think this is actually legal cuz I'm so far black boxing most of it

533
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,471
Must be other docs were from people who didn't blackbox it

534
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Switch case

535
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,895
I promise I'm doing this for the purpose of interoperability instead of marketing new

536
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
Products or something

537
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
I think I don't remember what are the rules surrounding that

538
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
D4

539
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:35,327
So you're at zero eight says you're xd4 so right now I can see with 7

540
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
Indifference

541
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
Between 8 and 5

542
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,447
Set 123

543
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,799
And I can say 0xd 4 - 0 x 89

544
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
D4 - 89 is to be

545
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:55,039
And the 2D hacks which is 43

546
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,695
Phase 10 and that means that the code that I'm receiving from the

547
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
Controller the thing it says 43 is 43 I'm guessing 48

548
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:13,471
Millions of a second because everything else inside this thing operates at 48 million for the 2nd

549
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
By the way this is a perfect time to plug the esp32 which I'm not getting any special treatment from Express

550
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Estefan

551
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:25,247
I mean other than keeping me the parts a little early

552
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:31,647
The esp32 I just found out earlier this week in an example I can pull from up to 16 pin in

553
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,231
Parallel at 40 MHz not 4840

554
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
But you know start thinking about that

555
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:43,167
Charles I sent you a package of firmware has it been mentioned that they just come with steam VR

556
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,263
Can one of you guys open it I can't

557
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Competitive

558
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,687
Okay I don't have I don't I don't really feel comfortable pulling it up on the livestream cuz I can't

559
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
Filter

560
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,527
I only have one display so

561
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,135
Mindy you're going to open it okay so somebody is is on opening it

562
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
Gmail

563
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:12,863
Okay so going to be opening that

564
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
So consider this might be all for nothing but let's just go through it anyway I'm going to keep going at this until the other stuff

565
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Comes through

566
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:26,687
So what this says right here the 43 is that when I was running for five psycho

567
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,783
12345

568
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
Then this thing thinks it was on for a 19 when I dated thought it was D4

569
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,303
Which means that it was 43 more 48 millionths of a second

570
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,423
Per thing per cycle so I'm probably a higher frequency than I should

571
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,215
We can actually calculate that out

572
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,287
So if it's 43

573
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
Switch to decimal

574
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,175
Bye-bye 48 millionths of a second

575
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,087
Education background

576
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:11,743
I have a regular degree from UMBC and I went back for my masters

577
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
In what

578
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,631
Oh I went to school specifically for computer engineering

579
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,447
And then I decided I wanted to do gamedev

580
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
So I went back for

581
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
A master's in computer science

582
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,615
And I decided I didn't want to do game data so I went back to hardware

583
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,943
That's Story of My Life

584
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,063
Scientific automatic how to do that

585
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,623
.895 9

586
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
I really want to watch

587
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,399
Start with USA protocol been Jackson's name

588
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
From where

589
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,543
But I already know most of the USB protocol

590
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:03,455
I'm a little confused by the statement been Jackson's making with regards the USB

591
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,855
Xavier is compression arcane

592
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:15,743
Not modern well

593
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
There can't be very much compression because

594
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
I can see a pattern emerging so it can't be

595
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
Not much really odd because I don't

596
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:33,407
They follow pretty clear B pattern

597
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,695
Especially men.

598
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,863
Where Point fired those are his messages from the wireless dongle

599
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399
Wired USB protocol

600
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,287
Oh no that's been very well-documented and it's

601
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:05,407
Zero-interest me I specifically want the wireless protocol

602
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,527
The wired one appears to be from what I can tell almost identical to this

603
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,951
As far as what the messages are for the light information I'm pretty sure it's pretty well-documented in the lighthouse redox stuff

604
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,095
I can pull it up

605
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:33,823
Although if you want to give me some details about with his Arcane compression is that be pretty cool

606
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,711
Pitot tube

607
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
I guess they haven't

608
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,607
Time length

609
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
Sensor ID so it's almost identical to this I got to just uses 8 b b packets instead of 7 to describe

610
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Dissenters

611
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:10,175
So I'm not really interested in having this wired all the time

612
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
Moving on so maybe in the background you guys will give me the stuff to do the thing

613
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
Right now I will keep on showing people how I reverse engineer cuz that's kind of the purpose of this video

614
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:29,375
So 43 until right now when I'm trying to figure out its what is the actual clock rate of this

615
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
Little Flashing LED right here

616
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,495
And so it's going to be 43

617
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
Units

618
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:41,407
And that's 4348 millionths of a second

619
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,015
Which is 89-59 of a wavelength

620
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
3

621
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,695
2.6 MHz that's a little bit too hot

622
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
See what happens if I drop it to that

623
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
E1

624
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,359
That's weird why would that be faster

625
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
Maybe I am running into compression thing

626
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,815
He won the firmware for the controller

627
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,143
I guess

628
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,495
I'll be looking into the VR controller

629
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,079
So this one is now

630
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,871
B5

631
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,151
Okay so I just did the same thing I did up there so

632
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,503
1 - P4 is a total of

633
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:26,111
194 total of 45

634
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:30,975
Do iguanas that's a little bit fast let's try 70

635
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:44,031
Oh that's interesting it's a text that the signal lot further away so totally believe that my frequency was little bit too

636
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
U-high

637
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,359
The right now it's a sick

638
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,303
If we bump that up to eight

639
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:11,935
So it'll make it last longer and we'll see what this second value is right here

640
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,775
Who's that says C

641
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
App cbspd

642
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,439
Hello

643
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Set 37 total difference

644
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,751
Picking my division is wrong

645
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,015
1.2 9729

646
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:12,095
I'm thinking this might not actually be the time I was expecting it what's up let's crafthouse more data points

647
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,935
So you did

648
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,983
58

649
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,639
Hopefully this thing on a little bit longer let's leave it on for 16 total cycle zero x 10

650
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
The state says

651
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Who

652
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
That's interesting now it says

653
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
01

654
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:39,487
So what my guess is but now I realize it's a large enough number that it needs to expand the next digit

655
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,583
Cam so this is this is a little concerning

656
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,495
That means that this is actually a longer string now because that was those different so these are not fixed

657
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Fields

658
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,799
In the string

659
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,591
So let's see here

660
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,711
Are you in the folder

661
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,783
Define Aristo

662
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,111
Xbox One

663
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,767
I need a little bit

664
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Say

665
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,631
Watchmen dongle. Bin

666
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,983
Pi +

667
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,175
I could do this on this laptop

668
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
No

669
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:38,879
Can you make sure that you can you mix with USB drives empty before

670
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,415
Trying to herd a copy the data

671
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,719
Certainly not empty

672
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,047
Okay

673
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:58,847
I don't care if you see what's on it I just don't want the internet

674
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,431
I don't know I left some light company stuff on there

675
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:10,111
I'm so right now going to soon look at the inside of a binary from valve here it gets this

676
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,207
Attributed with the vibe

677
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,279
What start taking a look at what some of these other ones

678
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,583
Don't even have a primary doctor

679
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,895
But I'll still take a look at him

680
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:37,247
Maybe 20 other files

681
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:43,903
Did he attack Senator okay so right now I'm in here is going to be digging through the firmware with

682
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:49,023
With the hex editor and seeing if she sees anything that would be

683
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,583
Clear enough for us to figure out what's really going on

684
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,935
So if I put out your ex 10

685
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,471
I got

686
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
8001

687
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:10,015
A little bit left but I was 15 let's try 15

688
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:23,071
Hold us up

689
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
Cold

690
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
A101

691
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
Hey what is the

692
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,735
What is the tea taste like

693
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
Awesome

694
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,815
We've been trying to figure out all this is at

695
01:01:55,071 --> 01:02:00,959
Who trying to figure out a necktie Ice-T for a while now and we're starting to zero in on the recipe

696
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,775
Anyway

697
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,639
That's 15 you at 14 looks like

698
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:16,575
I'm trying to fill in the table here figuring out what all this means that's 9501

699
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
Coldest up again

700
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
8501

701
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,319
12

702
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,207
Holding it up

703
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,327
9:08 Fe

704
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,543
Interesting

705
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
Okay so right now we're right on the edge

706
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,687
If I hold it like this

707
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,575
Then it reads f f e r f f

708
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:27,231
Whoever get the f f f f

709
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:33,631
Just wright

710
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
It'll read 8

711
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,687
You have a request to copy paste a couple lines from the

712
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,807
Debunks fuel in the chat just for other people too

713
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:58,719
Okay okay so let's do that interesting data set

714
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:03,071
Because we were able to get it to go from both this size right here

715
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,655
To this size right here so I'm going to do is I'm going to post this

716
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,495
Let's do that right now

717
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,079
GitHub

718
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,855
I don't think there's anything

719
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,303
Okay doesn't show the private project

720
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,703
That would have been nervous anyway

721
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:44,799
So right here this is

722
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:51,455
Controlled environment with LED right on edge

723
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,551
I don't actually know the absolute length of time

724
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,255
Pretty good though

725
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,375
HTC Vive example data files

726
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,191
Recorded a little bit earlier

727
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
And they're not there

728
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:27,807
I'm going to have to record that data can get your hands on some of this data start playing

729
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,927
I will start recording it I'll go power on the lighthouses again

730
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:56,991
Oh okay so this is specifically if you go

731
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,783
Look at the

732
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,951
Okay if you look at my code I don't know where it is in the other people code right now I handle

733
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,255
Handoff all of the

734
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
Where is it

735
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,495
So it's under survive data

736
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,311
Hilton survived a to call back

737
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,943
When you get data from The Watchmen this thing right here

738
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:33,343
If it has an ID of 35 and he calls it just once but if the idea is 36 there's actually two,

739
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,391
Copy or two separate messages

740
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:40,511
In the same packet so that's how it knows to go call

741
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,911
They handle the Watchman for the 29 B packet can handle Watchmen

742
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,727
All this code is on my GitHub right now

743
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,823
I guess I could make a push you guys can check it out under a live survive

744
01:06:54,079 --> 01:07:00,223
We had to pull earlier that lube survive or live survive I made it I'm calling at light survive

745
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:06,623
Just like gifts they were gifts but now you gave them the man gave them to the internet and we

746
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,159
Decided call them gifts

747
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:14,559
Like when you get a child you can rename them I don't know if that's a practical thing to do but maybe it is

748
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
Anyway

749
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:22,751
There's that data not good so now we have kids coming in on this thing so right now what I'm going to do

750
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:29,151
I'm is I'm going to by the way

751
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:35,551
After I have parked out everything I know how to parse out all of the triggers all of the buttons all of the IMU

752
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,183
I'm pretty sure this is just like data I'm going to take this I'm going to go put it on the ground over there

753
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:46,559
And I'm going to go collect some data and dump it in that just for you guys

754
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,215
By the way the whole thing about that was totally Adams

755
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Line

756
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,311
Sun logging some data right now

757
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:07,551
Who made all this wonderful day that you guys can go have fun with this

758
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,655
Okay I'm going to

759
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:28,031
Guess I could can I log into Twitter's that have anyting Twitter

760
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
I thought it

761
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:37,759
Do you want me to open some windows computer sending people that

762
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
Moschino it

763
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,559
Here's

764
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,119
Comdata

765
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
Calm the livestream

766
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:03,359
So if you're watching this right now and you want to go play with the data just get it from my Twitter

767
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
I just commented

768
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
And while I'm here

769
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
She probably

770
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
How do I get

771
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,903
The URL of my

772
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,791
How to get the URL of this live stream

773
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
Can you tweet that to me

774
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,471
Mural

775
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:36,895
Worry about that a minute

776
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:43,295
Call the complete with all these crazy

777
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:49,695
And if you guys can parse it awesome so we're going to start actually maybe getting a little bit feedback from you guys soon

778
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,743
That is assuming the

779
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:56,607
The reverse-engineering the binaries is not going well we'll find out about that in a few minutes

780
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,543
What's the strongest power off the lighthouse

781
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:20,415
I'm responding to your sweet summer

782
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,719
Watch the live stream here

783
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:26,303
I think it's public right everybody would Co know people who

784
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,191
I would have to tweet it out for other people to see it right or did they see that the chain

785
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:39,359
I think everyone's just tweeted to me and probably good enough

786
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:45,759
Tweeted out again later so here we go back to what we were doing this thing here just

787
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,831
We found an interesting bit where

788
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,671
The thing took up two values instead of one

789
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
Ha

790
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:06,495
We happening at happens monotonically that is that this led is going poop for a fixed period of two

791
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,567
It's going into

792
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,847
Good thing right here

793
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:17,247
And it's showing that number so now I'm just curious I just want to see what it looks like

794
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:29,535
Say 10 microseconds again what happened

795
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:36,191
I just I don't know let's find out what happens if I poop twice so now I'm pooping

796
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:41,055
Wants to see the LED waiting 10 microseconds and I'm pooping again

797
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,871
So see what this looks like

798
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:49,247
That's cool so now we're getting a longer day to message

799
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:56,927
And the boot data looks confusing to me

800
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
That's really confusing

801
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:09,471
So if you look and see if I can touch this with my

802
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
So I can use the computer with my toe

803
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,175
You look

804
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
Weird

805
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
He look where we still have the the fa fa if I go high enough

806
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,951
Somehow there is 8001

807
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,071
And that's around the same time I don't see anything like that earlier here

808
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,887
I wonder what's up with that so icy

809
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
08:08

810
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,495
80

811
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
Oh

812
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,175
You know what we forgot to do

813
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:56,575
Got to reset marker so this Firstmark what happened was it would start and then it would subtract

814
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,927
Marker 12 times it was only a very short period of time

815
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,327
Then when marker was zeroed keep executing down here and have a really long ball

816
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,423
So let's reset it to both pulses are about the same length of time

817
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,111
We're getting the same behavior we saw before

818
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671
Where we would have between

819
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:39,327
To go between F9 sff all that when I go over-the-top it would go up to

820
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:43,679
1301 the same thing here

821
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:54,431
People saying to explain yourself I don't know exactly what they mean by that but

822
01:13:54,687 --> 01:14:00,831
Causing your little thing to send a signal to make the LED years ago

823
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,623
Seeing something

824
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:09,279
Okay so Adam has pointed out that we discovered set up I'm going to go try to increase the resolution

825
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,071
Hopefully it doesn't explode

826
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,887
See

827
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,215
320 by 2:40 Maybe

828
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:23,871
Explain how the LED is. This one of the, okay let's do a few things I'm home

829
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,271
Hoping the stinky pufferfish

830
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:36,671
5 right ear I have all of the lighthouses turned off

831
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:43,071
Both of the lighthouses

832
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:55,871
Table up to this right here which is an 80 to 85

833
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Kind of produce from spark I love them they're great

834
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:15,071
But I don't really care

835
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:21,471
AVR microcontroller

836
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,871
What to do things I have literally connected this led to controller and I can turn the LED

837
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:35,039
With this command and off with this command and when all of his code gets compiled to

838
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343
Two AVR code it

839
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
It bit off

840
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:46,047
It'll take literally one or two clock cycle operations and so that's why turns

841
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:52,447
Turn on subtract marker turn off turn on marker turn off

842
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:58,847
Whatever MHz

843
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:05,247
About

844
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:11,647
And point that at the thing that originally this it all started with the whole LED thing

845
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047
This thing right here

846
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:30,847
LED is flickering a high-frequency but it's flickering if the frequency that's necessary to read it into this thing

847
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,151
So

848
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:39,551
Is this correct

849
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
This up to it

850
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:47,999
I might get like a thing through here and there but it's it's really hard to to read where is now

851
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:54,399
Frequency

852
01:16:54,655 --> 01:17:00,799
Consider the data coming through

853
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:07,199
That is deliberately far away

854
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,599
Developers just told us that that the reason that this thing has to operate is the one

855
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,999
Waymaker hurts is because it's really far away and frequency space from these guys which operated 38

856
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:26,399
I mean I guess they can go to 56 but down it like below 64 kilohertz 1.8 MHz

857
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:32,799
54 khz that's why this doesn't hose up your system if your you have a remote control and

858
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:39,455
Oh my gosh did you guys imagine a TV be gone for 5 to take a TV be gone in flash it with the drive

859
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:45,855
Xbox one anyway

860
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:52,255
Let's go back to what we're actually doing over there

861
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:58,143
Searching through the binaries

862
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:04,799
I seen some plain text that says something about dolls bootloader

863
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:12,735
Nothing

864
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,367
Revolver

865
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:25,279
Mindy's right now going through the binaries the firmware binaries that are distributed with the the Valve controller

866
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:33,215
And none of them look like they're playing text or anything

867
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,103
Something bracelet

868
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,687
Weiser meant to be able to have multiple operating in the same space

869
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
Are they

870
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:51,903
I don't know I just realized I didn't have the camera on that whole time

871
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,255
There's Mindy and there is her there's your code

872
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,863
So she's right now looking through the binaries in HEX editor

873
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:07,263
Trying to look for any kind of

874
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,567
That's not it

875
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:15,455
Are these ones here

876
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,551
The various. Bin files that come with

877
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:32,607
I'm in the firmware here is why I unzipped from the guy from we're here so

878
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,935
City on that screen

879
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,239
Oh really I don't know bummer

880
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:53,087
File strings

881
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:59,743
And strength to look for strings inside of a binary Brendan was talking to me and saying to use

882
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:06,143
Unix file to look for strings inside of a binary I've never done that

883
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,191
How about how about Brendan goes in

884
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,592
But looks for some reason

885
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:20,992
YouTube friends over there and he's suggesting

886
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:25,856
Start working on looking at the binaries to I just thought of is

887
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:32,256
Is anyone going to tell me what what processor these things use cuz maybe we can just get a copy of like one of the arms will kids

888
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:38,656
Disassembler on that assembly then

889
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:45,056
I'm not wasting my time trying to figure out what the assembly does

890
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,856
Go back to the Daily Grind here

891
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:04,256
What I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to see what is 12

892
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,328
12 is

893
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:18,848
Act weird

894
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:32,672
Stressing this is actually really interesting but I see is icy 080

895
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:39,072
08 FC 8201a 501

896
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:45,472
Something is a 201 in a 501 look like they're almost the same number

897
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,872
Which is really interesting

898
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:58,272
So I would think maybe it's the value twice

899
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:05,440
So I'm seeing right now some seeing 0808 which maybe like which

900
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:11,840
Which sensor is so I 2020 08 08 maybe that first coat is which sensor I don't know what the

901
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:18,240
Tsp is right now but I do see that the that the length of time that the pulse is on

902
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,264
Twice

903
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,152
In a row so that that that leave me to really start thinking about that

904
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:29,504
Let's go back and let's start documenting this

905
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:39,232
If you guys think of something you'd like to talk about on the video it's some point whenever you get to find something

906
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
So by having the pulse happen twice like 301 a 6in 0183

907
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:25,312
Give me a heads up as to what these fields mean so right now what I could do is

908
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:31,712
But the thing is is I'm sorry whoops Oda 201

909
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:38,368
It's non-paid 601 what happens if I speed

910
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:44,768
BB's Apso make this say 15 + 15

911
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:57,568
Compressor that's interesting

912
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,088
There is no such thing as USB compression

913
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:16,256
He said Arcane right

914
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:23,424
Maybe it's I don't know what he meant by compress

915
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,520
You can't compress the data and put it in a packet

916
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:33,152
Done said now you figured out 08080 give you an important tip basically

917
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:39,552
Starting after the away to wait on one going in reverse

918
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:44,672
Can you let me go okay I'll do it live here

919
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,864
Okay what do I do

920
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:59,264
Okay so it's been Jackson shirt is the first part would probably kill you trying to figure it out

921
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,664
Screw up once one starting after the 0808 and one going in reverse from

922
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,064
End

923
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:24,864
90 now fool 90 people

924
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:35,104
What variable length

925
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:43,552
Oh okay everything after those 0808 is to variable-length fields of data

926
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,488
Already knew about the only do anything last night I just had no idea anything else beyond that

927
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,168
Okay and I keep going

928
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:17,344
Okay so I can compare these two lines so

929
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,000
That's interesting fc01

930
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,352
9 fo1 and FC

931
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:36,800
I make no sense why is that if I do in there

932
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,224
This is really confusing

933
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:49,856
Those two lineup those two lineup

934
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:58,560
Maybe this is a time offset like in time after that happen this happened

935
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,608
Let's test that

936
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,104
Twice Mina

937
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,176
How does that work is that picking up at it up from his room

938
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,736
We're both teams in the video

939
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,296
But he said Hot Spring Point than I am

940
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,160
Oh okay

941
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:30,560
Okay

942
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
Let's let's try to increase the delay time between these two

943
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:07,936
I don't necessarily news-washington module but it is Watchmen

944
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:14,336
Open Smart fan module in Washington Seattle jungle

945
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:20,736
I got to know how in the world did this Ben guy know that the channel is going on

946
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:31,232
He said earlier

947
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,632
He said finally something useful showed up in his feet about that considering all I'm doing is just tinkering

948
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,424
At 15

949
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:45,824
At 10 US between so first

950
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,688
Numbers about the same second number is larger

951
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:53,248
Third number is about the same

952
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:59,648
So what this says to me is first number is we have a sensor codes

953
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:05,536
First number is pulse time second number is

954
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:17,056
Oxy pulse * 1

955
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,360
Just probably

956
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,408
Call Ira

957
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,064
Length of time between pulses and pulse time to

958
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,464
Okay let's test that

959
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,144
Instead of using your body shotgun am actually like doing the scientific method

960
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:48,544
Tshaka meaning change

961
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:54,944
Now I'm actually changing only one variable at once increased the start time here and make this

962
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,992
20 Cycles

963
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:02,880
Message for you Ben Johnson

964
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,144
Can You Stand The Rain I don't even know whatever

965
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:45,632
Oh Jackson why did I say constant whatever okay

966
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:52,032
Now we're doing it with the increasing the spirit. Of time to the first one and see how that changes to stream

967
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,904
Hey that looks pretty good that was real

968
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:14,304
Really good so if you look between these two

969
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:26,848
The difference between these two streams right here this one and this one is that this one increased

970
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:33,248
The marker time a little bit so means that for the first one to pause a little bit longer and so the only things that she

971
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:39,648
Change the substance in the first part of which is all looking at right now is that it went from a-001

972
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,304
The da01 and for the second one it went from its got the same for the third one is about the same

973
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,704
So now just to check my logic here I'm going to try changing the length of time of the second Paul and see if this number here

974
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:59,104
20

975
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:05,504
Boom

976
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:18,304
How got home the firmware

977
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:24,704
Halt this is really good data oh my gosh yes so now we

978
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,104
We did at twenty at 20 at 10 u.s. between oh my gosh

979
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
We're we're cooking so what we have here is code 1co to

980
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:43,904
And this is definitely so it's sensor codes it's definitely Paul's Time 1

981
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
Link between impulses time to

982
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,704
Vetoed what is that number what how do I figure out what that is in absolute terms so I'm going to do is win

983
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:04,128
Microseconds between text and see what that goes down by

984
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:10,528
Hope it still give me data

985
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,584
But I don't know if you want I can probably just like tape

986
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:29,984
Just to hear but probably just put it on the floor but I can't hold it up and see you guys every time

987
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:36,384
Cell

988
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:55,328
Ed bringer

989
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:04,544
So this is concerning

990
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,944
I don't know how to tell the difference between this and this

991
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:17,344
So clearly they're doing something to make it to the the width of the variables the width of the number

992
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,744
Numbers can be variable but I don't know how to tell how many

993
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,120
Bite each thing should take

994
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:36,032
How am I

995
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,432
I'm going to tell that tell you what I'll do

996
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:52,672
What would they have done the developers what would they have done all my allowance for a solve this

997
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:59,072
You want him to keep spoiling it for us I really want to know though how do I

998
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:05,472
Tell how many bytes given field is going to take

999
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:11,872
I guess we could do is we could scan across a variety

1000
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:18,272
Let's let's go back to the most degenerate case for one pulse let's go back to 21 pulse

1001
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:24,672
Cheilosis test it

1002
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:31,072
Hookah shop

1003
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:37,472
That's da01

1004
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:03,328
If you guys have something for more wise at some point soon that would be really helpful so I can take a break

1005
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:11,264
No nothing it just looks like trash

1006
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,664
Uh what you say Brandon

1007
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,064
Do you have anything interesting you want to talk about

1008
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:30,464
There's more spoilers okay

1009
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:36,864
Talk about how you're thinking about using the Kalman algorithm Kalman filter to figure out the locations of stuff

1010
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:43,264
If you wanted to talk about that at some point

1011
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:49,664
Okay if you want to think about it over the next couple minutes I don't need to I don't need to

1012
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:56,064
Break right now but

1013
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:02,464
Talk about like the sympathizer which technically is the Charles Moore

1014
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:07,584
That's okay looks like

1015
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:15,008
E2

1016
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:21,408
Did it nicely asset

1017
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:34,208
What's up is the Watchman dongle. Been

1018
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,944
That can't be right that must be the wrong processor

1019
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:01,344
So right now I'm Mindy is visible

1020
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,744
She's right now opening the binary in a tool that can decompile 4D assemble it

1021
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,144
But these assembly codes don't exactly mesh fence

1022
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:20,544
Maybe they are maybe they're not sometimes when you reverse decompile

1023
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,944
Program into the wrong processor and even can look like a real real coats

1024
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:33,344
Funny story where somebody took and they put it through at 8 8051

1025
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:39,744
Decompiler perfectly there was Zero undefined things

1026
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,328
Except for this like one place that looks like maybe they were using that

1027
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:49,728
And they realized that the 8051 opcodes have no opcodes that aren't opcodes and

1028
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:56,128
Reverse engineer something

1029
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:02,528
The dongle is 8051 is he just messing with me why would a dongle be 8051

1030
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,832
Actually let's Google that

1031
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,304
This is Cyprus part in there

1032
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,680
Apod

1033
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,776
There's no way

1034
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,896
Why would it be

1035
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:48,352
Someone else mentions the 24 hour

1036
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:55,264
Whatever

1037
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,104
Yes the all you that wasn't 8051 in there

1038
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,920
Interesting choice for

1039
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:08,320
Now I'm kind of curious do you have an fpga on board that does the timing for rent round-robin

1040
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:14,720
Not round-robin like check when any of these get hit and then that report soft piano riff 24-hour one

1041
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:21,120
And Nordic wifi chip that does the the other part actually

1042
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:27,520
Another one I wonder if this is protocol compatible with the nrf24 l01

1043
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,616
Easy to make your own dongles anyway

1044
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:37,248
Turn down five

1045
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:43,136
Whatever I don't even need to know that since if you're saying that it's the Nordic chip it's probably

1046
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:49,536
Free music

1047
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:55,680
If you somebody tells you something doesn't do USB they're just not trying hard enough

1048
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:06,176
Go back to this now

1049
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:12,576
Da01 is that how do we know why

1050
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,880
When we advance to the next fight

1051
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:21,536
Started at the wrong place I don't know if it changes anything

1052
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:26,400
Where is there a way to change that actually we have to be different processor

1053
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,168
How do I

1054
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:32,288
Different disassembly

1055
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:38,688
851

1056
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:44,064
He wanted his number I don't know that maybe there is

1057
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:50,464
Now I'm so back to this back to actual reverse-engineer protocol here

1058
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:59,424
E2 and then another variable so I don't know what these are how did quite tell when

1059
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,728
When one thing would go on to the next

1060
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:04,544
So this is

1061
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,152
Hot tongue

1062
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
1011

1063
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
He won

1064
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
U2

1065
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,360
I know what we are I'm just going to take this together

1066
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,920
Where is the Gaff tape

1067
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:56,000
Dave do you think you'll be ready to talk about it briefly in a couple minutes

1068
01:42:56,256 --> 01:43:02,400
My magic my magic the paperclip

1069
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:08,800
Darn

1070
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,336
Okay

1071
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:18,528
Okay so I'm going to right now tape this thing to hear so I only have to use the keyboard to iterate through the site

1072
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,552
Cycle

1073
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:26,464
If you want instructions during an earthquake

1074
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:40,800
But I would really like it if some program

1075
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,104
Just took it and reverse-engineer it for me

1076
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,896
And even then

1077
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:50,528
I don't have a copy of Ida

1078
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,112
Hi whatever I'm going to keep going

1079
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,928
Okay so weird 11

1080
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,488
11 is 9

1081
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,096
12

1082
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,496
12 is F5 at 6

1083
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:19,712
And I don't even care about the rest of that I'm just kind of trash that

1084
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:25,344
Call what's 213

1085
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,536
13 is 8201

1086
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:41,216
How World am I going to tell the difference

1087
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,408
Maybe I'm just not looking low enough

1088
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,688
Tryon

1089
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:53,248
Hi going lower

1090
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:57,088
Whatever

1091
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,440
Is there more to the name 8051

1092
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,256
No

1093
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,960
Drawing games

1094
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:23,968
I was going to go back so Mindy found

1095
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,760
Online decompiler here

1096
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,808
Public under architecture

1097
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,136
Lookers just like a lot of fun

1098
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:35,744
Cedar cubby something that's xt285

1099
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,144
8051 8051 traditional

1100
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,080
Asem 51

1101
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,688
Open source tools

1102
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:57,248
Someone else online set

1103
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:01,600
Somebody said asem might be a good online source

1104
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:07,488
And that also looks ancient

1105
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,144
Freeware program for MS-DOS okay

1106
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,960
Let's keep going here so

1107
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:20,800
Let's see what 93 is burn

1108
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:23,616
A7

1109
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,896
08

1110
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,624
I'm going to make it really low

1111
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,208
I don't even know if that'll trigger

1112
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,936
Now 3 is not enough to make a trigger

1113
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,520
Motorcycles for enough to make a trigger

1114
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:56,384
Now for is not 5

1115
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,504
Now

1116
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,064
Changing the frequency

1117
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:12,256
Haha that's what it is a little bit lower made it more sensitive

1118
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,376
Back to four Cycles

1119
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,960
No still nothing

1120
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:28,384
So right now I'm changing the clock rate on the part

1121
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,224
Right there with that little bit weird that that's

1122
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,904
Anyway

1123
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,536
I'm changing the clock rate see if I can find a clock rate where the part is more susceptible to

1124
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,096
Receiving the signal

1125
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,960
That looks like no

1126
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:58,592
Okay looks like 5 is the shortest pulse I can actually generate

1127
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,712
The ideas are flooding in

1128
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:08,832
Make a Super Nintendo adapter to play Star Fox with the five

1129
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:22,144
Esp32 Scott a little more power than you think although I don't think I can hook an HDMI cord up to it what that did

1130
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,728
Stop me to try to figure out if I can hook a PCI Express Port up to it

1131
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,848
Hey so five

1132
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:40,064
It's also kind of interesting

1133
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,368
85

1134
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:47,232
So one thing I'm just now noticing is that so

1135
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,448
What I'm seeing in the first column is even though sofive Cycles

1136
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,008
20 Cycles

1137
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:02,336
10 Cycles I would expect

1138
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:08,736
Like these numbers to be significantly larger so maybe what happens is there's some minimum number so like

1139
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,760
The number 80

1140
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,040
Port 80 hacks

1141
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:15,392
Represent 0 in this number and see maybe I don't know

1142
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,184
And

1143
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,744
As the number grows bigger and bigger and bigger

1144
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,072
Stover

1145
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,376
Then it goes into the next column

1146
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:30,240
And so zero in the most significant bit might be and I

1147
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:34,848
A mechanism to indicate a termination that's just a guess though

1148
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:42,528
Alexander suggest that HDMI is just fancy ethernet we already have that so

1149
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:48,672
How far to go HDMI is not fancy ethernet

1150
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:55,840
Least it's not fancy 10 pasty ethernet which I know how to do it so although to be fair that you have P30

1151
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,888
T2 can output to

1152
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,936
100 MB ethernet

1153
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,752
Can't wait to get that fired up

1154
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:07,872
Let's see here it's a da01

1155
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:14,016
If there's another interesting thing under new situation if I noticed that the first number here

1156
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:20,416
Has the the most significant bit set 208 means it's a 5 Dae

1157
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:26,816
29 at 5 they're all more than 127 so

1158
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:33,216
Maybe that's actually the factor maybe the compression maybe it's really that simple maybe that

1159
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:39,104
Look at the first bit the most significant bit and if the most significant date is A1

1160
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,176
Then this is the number

1161
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,016
If it's not a one it's a continuation

1162
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:48,064
Of the previous

1163
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,368
So

1164
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,696
That would mean that

1165
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,048
First of all I don't even know if the last four B here used

1166
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,704
Academy Annapolis 5 b here used

1167
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,592
They hard to tell there

1168
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:25,440
I'll probably do you think you have a I got to I got to take a break in the night

1169
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:30,560
So unfortunately don't have my chicken scratch with me but

1170
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:36,960
So we're going to take a break but the streams going to keep going

1171
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:43,360
David Chapman here he's going to go show you guys with his ideas are on how we're going to take this and collapse

1172
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:49,760
Into resolving with nothing more than the light and the IMU

1173
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:56,160
Where the headset is and where the controllers are so I'll be back in a couple

1174
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:02,560
Alright everybody David Charles

1175
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:08,960
Friends

1176
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:15,360
Development projects and things like that for a while and I had some idea

1177
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:21,760
He is on the common filter and right now

1178
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:28,160
Family ideas in chicken scratch on my notebook I started writing some code

1179
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:34,560
And unfortunately don't have most of my chicken scratch with me so I've been frantically

1180
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:40,960
The last five minutes or so trying to write down some of it

1181
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,984
But

1182
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:48,128
These are people okay

1183
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:50,944
These are the equations for a common filter

1184
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:57,344
Right now we have

1185
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,928
Xhat which is the very first I can't come

1186
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:05,280
Can't really see but if you look at the very first equation

1187
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,328
Exit

1188
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:14,240
Has to contain all of the information that you have about the

1189
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:20,640
Position of a center I need to contain the orientation

1190
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:27,040
And then this is your prediction

1191
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:33,440
Given that the position is a certain thing I'll give him the orientation I given the velocity of the Excel

1192
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:39,840
Alteration all of that has to be crammed into your ex hat term you have a linear model what you play

1193
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:46,240
Probably learned in it if he took office it's 101 that position

1194
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:52,640
Equals x KT + V not t + 1/2 80s

1195
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:59,040
If you just keep things simple in terms of your state Vector that would be

1196
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:05,440
Be a linear combination where the teacher in your time term is not a part of your state

1197
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:11,840
Time has only to do with the length of time for particular time step so your your time term

1198
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:18,240
Quick change from frame-to-frame that's okay the last turn the BX plus you

1199
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:24,640
K that has to do with some external process control in the state which I don't

1200
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:31,040
Think we'll have to deal with it not down below we have the covariance Matrix

1201
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:37,440
I'm so if you have some uncertainty in terms of what your position is

1202
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:43,840
If you were to take that uncertainty

1203
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:50,240
You have a standard deviation that's one thing but yet other the variance is the square of the standard deviation

1204
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:56,640
Let's generalise az2a covariance Matrix if you have a multidimensional array

1205
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:03,040
I'm so if you were to take the outer product of a matrix with itself that would be a way of describe

1206
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:09,440
Having the covariance Matrix around for awhile

1207
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:15,840
One of the things that the little bit tricky figure out which term

1208
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:21,472
For the particular model that you have and then how do you plug

1209
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:25,056
How do you plug

1210
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:31,712
Numbers into these matrices how do you build these matrices that actually math onto the fence

1211
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:38,112
Countries that we have and one of the things that's interesting about this

1212
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:44,512
Steve lights the lights sweep down and then they sweep across and then another one Suites

1213
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:50,912
And then it sweeps across actually get

1214
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:57,312
Angle measurement what the true position of of

1215
01:55:57,568 --> 01:56:03,712
After you know I guess 3 years 2 or 3 sweeps

1216
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:10,112
You might be able to construct where the position is if it's worth staying completely

1217
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:16,512
He's still but the thing is that it's not going to actually stay still so if you sweep is 30

1218
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:22,912
Is 30 Hertz then by the time you have a third sweep you even would have already moved to another

1219
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:29,312
Position that you have to incorporate your I owe you and your accelerometer data

1220
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:35,712
You have very different-looking data sets that you have to fuse together

1221
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:42,112
The you're not getting a true sense of the position all you're getting is constrain

1222
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:48,512
That the position is on a plane at a particular point in time so when we have a light flash

1223
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:54,912
Flashing like this there is a describe

1224
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:07,712
View of a lighthouse and if that hissed sensor

1225
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:14,112
Above win that measurement was recorded

1226
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:20,512
I'm kind of starting from the standpoint that out of all of that we already have a plane equal

1227
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:33,312
The figure out from two lighthouses what are the positions in orientations of lighthouses

1228
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:39,712
Just from the positions the point I think that is a pretty well-known problem in

1229
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:46,112
Computer vision but I haven't really thought about that assuming that

1230
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:52,512
Calibrated then we would need to just from the known position

1231
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:58,912
Assuming we have

1232
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:03,776
A plane equation and then we would need to stay at this point in time

1233
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:10,432
We know that the sensor is close to this plane

1234
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:16,832
And that plane is the plane that's formed by the angle of the

1235
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:23,232
Of the beam of the Lighthouse at the timestamp

1236
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:29,632
Observe the sensor

1237
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:36,032
Sounds like I'm talking at my ass I probably am because again was still kind of initial ideas

1238
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:42,432
And realize it didn't quite work

1239
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:47,552
This is what I'm thinking at the time and kind of what I'm trying to go on so

1240
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:54,208
My initial thought in terms of how do we construct a state vector x-rite

1241
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:57,792
Yeah the first the most important thing as a state Vector X

1242
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:04,192
How do we construct that state Vector my initial thought which could change if

1243
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:10,592
If you're not I haven't really I've implemented a toy common filter before

1244
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:16,992
But you know this will be definitely making something

1245
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:23,392
That's that's really really viable and again I could be talking out my ass when I say this coming up but

1246
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:29,024
My first thought is that in a common filter is effusive linear algebra

1247
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:35,424
Linear algebra we need to have matrices and in particular we want

1248
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:41,824
To be able to a lot of these steps in the formulas that we have have a stinger

1249
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,224
Single Matrix X representing Steph and so

1250
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:54,624
Different ways of representing a rotation you could use a quaternion you could use an accent

1251
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:58,720
Angle you could use three Euler angles

1252
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:05,376
But my initial thought was that if we want to represent a rotation using a

1253
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:11,776
Single Matrix X then I'm thinking that

1254
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:18,176
Haitian Matrix might be a good format to know the right

1255
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:24,576
The right Peg for the right hole again that that might invite

1256
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:30,976
Not to be a problem because a matrix of rotation Matrix

1257
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:37,376
Has nine terms and it only really takes three terms to represent a rotation

1258
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,776
Could be that the system is under constrained in ways that could make a problem I think more than life

1259
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:50,176
Likely I think it won't be a problem because a lot of what you describe

1260
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:56,576
Here are covariance matrices so representing

1261
02:00:56,832 --> 02:01:02,976
In fact that the Peter here that the second equation is a covariance matrix on position

1262
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:09,376
And also in terms of our uncertainties we can say that certain

1263
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:15,776
Turn the linearly dependent on others so I'm thinking that there might be a way that we could encode in our insert

1264
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:22,176
Certainty Matrix that even though there are 9 terms some of them are our Coral

1265
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:28,064
Or actually identical to each other so so that's

1266
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:34,464
That's the first thought thought is that we need to have position velocity and acceleration so

1267
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:40,864
My initial thought it said if we need to represent all three of those again this is really chicken scratch

1268
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:47,264
But we need to have 12 terms for the position

1269
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:53,664
3 for each of the columns of the rotation Matrix the rotation Matrix really represents a

1270
02:01:53,920 --> 02:02:00,064
AAA coordinate system and maybe a quaternion would work better because it would only be for

1271
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:06,464
4 * I'll have to think about that little bit more whether quaternions are used with common filters or

1272
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:12,864
Rotation Matrix seems like the most obvious thing to do but you need to have 12 terms

1273
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,264
For each of position velocity and acceleration so so that would be

1274
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:25,664
12 * 336 36 terms if if we win you know that route

1275
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:32,064
Reasoning that's what the state of one you know headset is at the time

1276
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:38,464
Now one thing that I was thinking about is that if we

1277
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,864
We have this common filter in the update space we need to determine

1278
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:51,264
We need to determine a number of matrices just why I hear this has to

1279
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,664
To do with the error residual

1280
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,760
Residual in measurement

1281
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:08,160
Are your observed measurements at a time Steph K and on the right

1282
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:14,560
Trx4 is your predicted state

1283
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:20,960
And then each year is a matrix that transforms your state into

1284
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:27,616
Measurement

1285
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:34,016
Abs abs observations minus calculations we have our observe measurements and

1286
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:40,416
Then we have to calculate what do we expect those measurements to be and if

1287
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:46,816
If we can do that then the long story short is that

1288
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:52,960
You have to plug that into this magic formula we're really this are termed

1289
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:59,360
Represent your uncertainty in measurements and we need to ask tomates somehow

1290
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:01,920
Uncertainty in measurement

1291
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:08,320
From the sensors that we have and that's something and I I'm not sure how much

1292
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:14,720
There's documentation on how accurate these sensors are with her we have to measure that by just

1293
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:21,120
Empirically from moving them around and seeing you know how how

1294
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:28,032
How how uncertain the measurements are but so that that's something we'll

1295
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:34,432
I'll have to look at and and if you do that then I belong

1296
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:39,296
Long story short is that is that you can

1297
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:45,696
Invert that Matrix an estimated comandini commongame will tell you how

1298
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:52,096
How much of your next state estimate should come from observation versus calculation

1299
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:58,496
So one other tricky thing how do you integrate a plane equation

1300
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,032
Into a common filter

1301
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:06,944
And I think that'll be the last thing I want to talk about because that's that's kind of the treat I mean

1302
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:13,344
But this plane

1303
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:19,744
Equation where you only have you don't measure the whole position you only measure part of the position

1304
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:26,144
I'm so what I was

1305
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:32,544
A plane equation in all of that and that is because what's going on

1306
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:38,688
And so if I have the controller here and it seems sweet

1307
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:45,088
By the laser in the lighthouse then it doesn't it's going to get I got hit at this time I got hit at this time I got him

1308
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:51,488
Where along the plane hit

1309
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:57,888
Inside the planet was hit

1310
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:04,288
So in order to resolve actual position you have to do this plane this plane and from another

1311
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:14,784
And you know both when it hit here and this plane then all you get is equation for a line

1312
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:21,184
The second Lighthouse to get the whole Interstate to where it is

1313
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:27,584
Remember that we're dealing with planes not lying directly it's not like other computer vision systems

1314
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:33,984
Correlate and have two cameras pointed at something and know the coordinate that the object whose that here all we know

1315
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:40,384
Somewhere along this playing any given time

1316
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:46,784
How do we how do we get that into the form of a of a common filter and I have

1317
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:53,184
Diagram here is a really crude diagram there but you

1318
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:59,584
Can see we have a lighthouse up at the top here and then we have a plane equation represented by normal

1319
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:05,984
Plane equation is ax + b y + z z equals so that plane

1320
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:12,384
Would have coordinates a b and c and ND for the for the plane now let's say we have

1321
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:18,784
A axyz which is measured by

1322
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:25,184
By that measured by that plane

1323
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:31,584
The XYZ Starwood Bebe state would be would be the state so

1324
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,984
If we have our state xhat right exit would have 36 terms

1325
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:44,384
If we formulate it that way which maybe that's not the best construction but we'll have to play with it

1326
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:57,184
We're allowed to construct a different a different

1327
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:03,584
Observation Matrix every frame

1328
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,960
It's at time stamp so that means that h2k -1

1329
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:15,360
Could potentially be a different Matrix and h2k - 2

1330
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:21,760
There is only one plane equation for the position of that leis of

1331
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:28,160
That playing at that given point in time so we can actually put that into our

1332
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:32,512
A matrix to convert

1333
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:38,912
To convert our predicted State into the same format as our measure

1334
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:45,312
And when I say the format is as of the measurement I'm talking about any format that would fit into the,

1335
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:51,712
Filter that we can come up with some of the data that we received

1336
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:58,112
The transformation to get it into a format that we can actually use in a common filter

1337
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:04,512
Would just be a column Vector is if we wanted to go this route

1338
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:10,912
Could just say that the normals of that plane would be equal

1339
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:17,312
Perms

1340
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:23,712
The product the matrix product of K

1341
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:30,112
Be just a single point D and that point would so how far along

1342
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:36,512
How far along is theft to the plane at at that

1343
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:42,912
Given point in time in which we estimate the plan so so that would mean

1344
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:49,312
That our measurement would be essentially how far along the normal the plane

1345
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:55,712
Did we measure it and then our observation is how long of how far from the norm of the plane

1346
02:09:55,968 --> 02:10:02,112
Would be how far to the normal plane

1347
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:08,512
Would our is our estimate XYZ

1348
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:14,912
So we can kind of force that. Product to happen by putting it into our

1349
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:21,312
Conversion from from the state Vector into a measurement space and I measure

1350
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:27,712
It is just the distance to the plane to the particular plan that we care about at that point in time

1351
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:34,112
So that would be give us a one-dimensional sreeja one-by-one matrix

1352
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:40,512
And I pray for those of you who don't know the inverse of a one-by-one matrix is the reciprocal

1353
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:46,912
So would be a lot more

1354
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:53,312
Incorporating the IMU accelerometer data but for incorporating the plane equations

1355
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:59,712
Are you can actually if it's if you can fit your most of the plane equation into just your

1356
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:06,112
Matrices

1357
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:12,512
Say is it's just a single dimensional object so we can constrain the point

1358
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:18,912
Hopefully to the plane a little bit by by using that as a way of

1359
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:25,312
Of as a data but not a data format FedEx but it is essentially a

1360
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:31,712
A format that would be compatible with the equation of a common Soldier sleds that's kind of as far as I've gotten idea

1361
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:38,112
DIYs I started writing some of the code but

1362
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:44,512
How that goes and we'll see if if all these ideas can out of scripture fix the drawing board on some of them

1363
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:50,912
That's that's kind of the long lines I'm taking right now

1364
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:57,312
Hey guys so honestly

1365
02:11:57,568 --> 02:12:03,712
Kind of bad but I honestly don't understand all of the mathematics involved there

1366
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:10,112
And I think it's really important to remember that when you do have opportunities to work with other people on team you'll

1367
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:16,512
There are a lot of people who know a lot of things that you don't know a lot of people whose brains work in ways that yours

1368
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:19,584
Doesn't and in most of what I do with like

1369
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:25,728
Here's your pen

1370
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:32,128
That that like at least electronics and all like I have a very very specific thing that I'm good at and I'm really only good at that

1371
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:38,528
Almond so I really do rely heavily on other people to really come in and infill in those areas that I just can

1372
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:44,928
I can't I would never be able to match this together I'm in fact in college I failed

1373
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:51,328
Calculus 2 and calculus 3 and actually had a name in the computer engineering department I was called

1374
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:57,728
Mathil so it is it is I'm just so glad that they've came along to

1375
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:59,776
Stick through all this

1376
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:04,896
I guess we should anything else or should we just get started again

1377
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,432
Oh

1378
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:13,600
And the discipline to go to the ATM but I don't know if I'm looking

1379
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:20,000
51 +

1380
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:26,400
Oh okay I'll just complicated

1381
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:32,800
They said it might take a few run-throughs if you like going to control

1382
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:39,200
Modify I think the original file anything different samples would eventually

1383
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:45,600
Ugly like vomit beautiful thing beautiful

1384
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:53,024
I still but

1385
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:56,096
This is

1386
02:13:56,352 --> 02:14:01,984
I don't know man yeah I would not be able to

1387
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:04,544
Figure out the algorithm

1388
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:10,944
Call Ben was that his name

1389
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:17,344
What was the guy's name from from valve in the Stream

1390
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:23,744
How can I was texting the right quick

1391
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,144
Suggested we look at the appreciate they're not encoded

1392
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:36,544
Send someone

1393
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:49,344
Encoding side is not in the dongle encoding side is not in the dongle

1394
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:55,744
Okay

1395
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:02,144
The dongle dongle

1396
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:08,544
Then what

1397
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:14,944
Okay anyway

1398
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:21,344
What these things mean so first of all let's just see if this works out if I assumed

1399
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:27,744
First let's just assume I'm going to assume here that all of these codes the light codes

1400
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:34,144
R&R

1401
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:40,544
I just assumed that for the light code numbers there also

1402
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:46,944
It says whether or not it's the field Studio 1820

1403
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:53,344
I'm going to make a prediction now and I'm going to say

1404
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:59,744
40 what's a 440 microseconds that would be DEA - 80

1405
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,584
15a

1406
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:09,984
Hey * 2

1407
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,520
Herbie

1408
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:17,920
Oob 15 - 80

1409
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:19,456
5A

1410
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,648
Taste buds

1411
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:32,000
218

1412
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:45,312
So what

1413
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:51,712
A VR a pulse for specific. Of time and going into the control

1414
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:58,112
And I'm looking at what codes come back from the controller for those specific. Of time

1415
02:16:58,368 --> 02:17:04,512
So I have da01 is the code for however long

1416
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:10,912
20 Cycles is and we're going to see how much 40 Cycles

1417
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:17,312
My prediction is that will be 436 months we decode it so let's find out if that's the case

1418
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:22,688
I make so we get ff7

1419
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:29,088
AO3 right there at 8:03 let's see what that decodes to

1420
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:35,488
40

1421
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:41,888
So that would be if we decode that it would be F 7 - 80

1422
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:46,752
Where's my calculator color is

1423
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:53,408
Ab77

1424
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:10,048
375

1425
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:30,272
A bunch of binary data in the front

1426
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:40,256
Are there particular instruction sets right like they mean something particular so what we're looking at here

1427
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:46,656
Is the disassembled code Mindy what tool did you use

1428
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:52,288
Right now running in Ubuntu on Windows get installed e52 I guess

1429
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:57,664
Outkast shirts to make sure is there first but yeah it was there

1430
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:04,064
And what we have is the location like this is a label basically

1431
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:07,136
The label comes in the left-hand column

1432
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:13,536
The instruction is the next one over in the parameters is the third column so if you see the one up there is

1433
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:19,936
06:00 D7 that means that there's something in the code that jumped potential

1434
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:26,336
Play 2 x 0 0 d 7 so I can function call or something like that

1435
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:30,688
Yep that's how you find it

1436
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:37,088
Yes but this is still very primitive and would be very hard to quickly reverse-engineer their Arkay

1437
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:40,672
Cases where you have to dig through the assembly to do the reverse engineering

1438
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:47,072
I'm making pretty good Headway with my side but right now we have two resources has absolutely no reason

1439
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:53,472
Not working parallel

1440
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:54,496
Okay well

1441
02:19:55,008 --> 02:20:01,152
Go for it

1442
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:03,456
8051

1443
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:10,368
Fifteen52 disassembler specifically for the 8:51 and 8:52 I guess

1444
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:22,400
Okay back to this estimated it should be 436 ticks but if

1445
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:28,800
Use the metrics that I decided that I thought of it comes to 375

1446
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:32,896
Text KT that's off by a lot I'm going to just try again

1447
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:38,784
And I will multiply Again by 2

1448
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,576
So I would guess

1449
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:48,000
What's 375 * 2 that's 6750 750 I guess so what's * pi

1450
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:50,560
By 2 that would be at 80

1451
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:54,400
And I'm going to keep the LED flashing 480 Cycles

1452
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:04,384
Okay I reprogram DVR and now let's see if that holds true

1453
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:17,440
He 580 at 80 Cycles in my estimate would be

1454
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:23,840
150 but let's see what the calculator says so I take 85 hacks

1455
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:30,240
Reset the top it so that's just five and then

1456
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:36,640
Is the second and that would be shifted over so that would be four

1457
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:39,968
Which is that bit right there

1458
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:45,856
I done wrong what's wrong for

1459
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:49,184
405

1460
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,096
No definite done something wrong

1461
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:58,656
Call 1029

1462
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:00,960
Okay that's interesting

1463
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:16,320
No I don't think I'm decoding this right I think that I must be doing something wrong for me to be getting those

1464
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,600
Kind of numbers

1465
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:29,376
Not 1771 F7 hacks

1466
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,704
1 after 7

1467
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:41,152
500 okay that's cool my gosh that's a problem wrong

1468
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:47,552
We're getting here what I'm doing

1469
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:53,952
A right here in here which I believe represent the length of the pulse I'm trying to attend a different value because I can control

1470
02:22:54,208 --> 02:23:00,352
All the input I'm going to set them to different values and honesty with the output says so that's what I've been doing

1471
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:06,752
And so right now I know for 20 units whatever that time unit is cuz I don't know exactly how fast patr

1472
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:13,152
Cars going code is 0 1 d a d a 0 1

1473
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:19,552
And my guess is that what these fields look like is in binary be term

1474
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:25,952
E65 before b3b to

1475
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:32,352
Do B10 and then the next byte is

1476
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:36,704
Are sorry 7

1477
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:39,520
1413

1478
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:45,920
1211 B10 b98

1479
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:52,320
Yes that's correct so but I think is going on I see a number like 850

1480
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:58,720
81 in binary

1481
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:05,120
Get comfortable with it because it lets you figure these things out a lot easier cuz you can start to see the patterns

1482
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:08,960
I'm stressed rather that's 8

1483
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:13,824
And then I'm going to put in E85

1484
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:17,408
And then I'm going to put it in here

1485
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:21,760
08

1486
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:28,416
Okay and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to move

1487
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:36,352
I'm going to move it around so that I actually see how I have B 6 is 0 B 5 is 0 B for

1488
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:42,752
0 B 302 is one that 100 is one

1489
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:46,848
Calculator here and I'm going to see

1490
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:53,248
This is just kind of a demonstration to show you what I think is going on I just think it was going to start a b 0

1491
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:55,808
That's a 1 b 1

1492
02:24:56,064 --> 02:25:02,208
Is a 025 2234

1493
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:08,352
Sticks are all 070809 a010 is 1

1494
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,680
That one fit 10

1495
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,960
No yes

1496
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:21,664
405

1497
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:26,784
So what did I do wrong why is that

1498
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:39,584
I got really excited now I'm a little bit confused

1499
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:49,568
Pulse timecode 1

1500
02:25:56,224 --> 02:26:01,344
8508 why did I think that was 1029

1501
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:09,280
I have to be

1502
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:15,680
I'm looking at the hexadecimal representation

1503
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:22,080
1029 okay got it so I think that's what's going on

1504
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:28,480
And so what I would do for two pulses we have that same sort of pattern going on

1505
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,576
What I'm guessing is that at

1506
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,624
08:08 so it's

1507
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,672
LED aleda

1508
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:38,208
Like a code wand

1509
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:41,024
Total distance between Tech

1510
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:47,424
Link the code to buy don't know what the remainder of these bites on this line are

1511
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:55,360
How about what we just learned and implemented

1512
02:26:55,616 --> 02:26:56,896
It and see what we get

1513
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:09,696
Oh actually you know what we should do first we should find out and see what three three bites look like

1514
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:26,080
Let's make 333 pulses of equal length and mlc

1515
02:27:26,336 --> 02:27:28,384
What that looks like on the the output

1516
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,176
Okay

1517
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:34,016
So the output of equal length

1518
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:38,112
Let's go and copy and paste these in and see what we get

1519
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:52,448
Okay the 78 I think that's going to be the LED

1520
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,728
Recorded on it

1521
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:56,544
Or was it recorded on a different holiday

1522
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:07,808
Okay what's record I guess I just wrote 08 I don't know why Road 08

1523
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:13,952
Maybe I copied something wrong

1524
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:20,864
Now I just copied something wrong

1525
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:27,264
So what I think is going on is 78 78 78

1526
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:32,640
Adidas LED this led

1527
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:39,040
Can I think this is the length of the sensor 1 on time this is the distance between the Sun

1528
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:43,904
7

1529
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:48,000
This is the next Hunters on time

1530
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:51,840
Link between sensors and this is the last sensors on time

1531
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:59,264
That's weird I don't know why the first one to be higher than

1532
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:05,408
Why would that be

1533
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:20,768
After 0 0 1 and aa2002

1534
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:25,376
Maybe the first maybe it's at the analog levels

1535
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,680
30

1536
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:30,240
I'll keep the first pulse on longer

1537
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:40,224
Case altez F40 2020k neither really was it

1538
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:42,784
25

1539
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:52,000
B302 okay so let me get a piece of paper

1540
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:58,400
Great

1541
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:08,128
I just realized I don't think I monetized

1542
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:10,944
Tan right now

1543
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:16,320
Oh

1544
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:23,744
So when I think is going to go on I think that

1545
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:33,216
I think that what's going on is so we have a signal coming from the AVR and it's being pulse

1546
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:39,616
Like this and what actually happens internally with the 5 I'm guessing it's a

1547
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:46,016
But there's analog circuitry that looks that and create kind of a fall like that

1548
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:52,416
What might be going on

1549
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:58,816
And going down rising up and going

1550
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:03,936
I'm down for shorter. The first one

1551
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:10,336
Then the second one and so that might be why the first Halsted

1552
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:15,200
Actually read it

1553
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:17,760
That's just my guess

1554
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:23,904
G302

1555
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:30,304
C77

1556
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:33,376
Distance between the pulses

1557
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:37,728
I'm going to go in here and when I increase that number

1558
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:44,384
So let's make it microseconds between pulses

1559
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,152
What's that

1560
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:51,552
32in so now instead of whatever it was before

1561
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:57,696
E1 E2

1562
02:31:57,952 --> 02:32:04,096
So a4e 2030k

1563
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:09,472
Now I'm curious what happens if

1564
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:15,872
Make that even bigger let's make it big enough to trip over the the boundary

1565
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:26,368
So now the numbers are bigger so now it's the first time

1566
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:32,768
But now instead of the second number being whatever it's now 9401

1567
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:40,704
Just into the file right now

1568
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:54,528
So 78 78 78 B 302

1569
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:56,320
9401

1570
02:32:56,576 --> 02:33:01,184
Tete-a-tete

1571
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:13,984
Four or however many numbers it is it could be like part of the CRC I don't know right now

1572
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:18,848
We are going to have to figure that out though

1573
02:33:19,104 --> 02:33:22,688
My guess is so let's roll this back in

1574
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,224
Bring it all back home

1575
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:26,528
In here

1576
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,856
And survived

1577
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:32,416
If I can find it

1578
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:37,792
Okay so when we get Watchman data

1579
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:40,352
Handle the watchmaker

1580
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:44,960
We pop off the date at the beginning of the packet the first bite is Time 1

1581
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:47,776
I can fight it the quantity of ice that we're going to be dealing with

1582
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:49,824
It is time to

1583
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:56,224
For all of these time codes on the vibe actually has to have four bites in order to

1584
02:33:56,480 --> 02:34:02,624
Generate a full number of 48 MHz Hicks since the thing began so that means

1585
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,416
Still looking for two more bites

1586
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:08,768
And so that could be at least two of those at the end

1587
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:11,328
So first of all

1588
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:14,656
I'm going to go have to write something to parse out

1589
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:17,728
The numbers as they are

1590
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:20,032
And then we'll go from there so

1591
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:24,384
Moisturizers another problem

1592
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:27,712
I don't know how to know

1593
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:33,856
How many of these there are how to tell the difference between 78

1594
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:37,696
And the actual data was

1595
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:41,280
I'll be things in the beginning 78 78 78

1596
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:44,864
That's which LEDs have been triggered

1597
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:51,776
All in our part of this this sorry which photodiodes have been triggered in her part of this message

1598
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:59,200
Just when I saw some that were like 80 and stuff like that

1599
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:02,016
The timestamp

1600
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:05,600
I think it is a timestamp

1601
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:08,928
Cuz we were missing two bites of the timestamp so

1602
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:12,512
We have the first two but we still need two more

1603
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:16,608
So that's possible and

1604
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:19,424
The first the most significant here I'll show you guys this

1605
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:25,824
The most significant to b b this one here in this one here you'll see that they actually keep counting up

1606
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:29,920
But the problem is down here that the lower lower B

1607
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:31,712
Are so sorry

1608
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:33,504
Here here they count up

1609
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:38,112
Toby 40 fb415 before 1B they keep counting up

1610
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:43,744
And later on because we're down in the noise now I can't really directly observe with it

1611
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,560
I don't have any way of knowing

1612
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:48,096
Pencils are actually missing

1613
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:50,400
3 what

1614
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:57,568
I don't believe her

1615
02:35:57,824 --> 02:35:58,336
Missing three

1616
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:00,128
Because isn't

1617
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:03,456
I have 11 by here

1618
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:04,736
I need

1619
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,784
Two more bites right just

1620
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:08,832
That makes

1621
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,392
Big

1622
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,672
Time thing

1623
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:16,256
Okay

1624
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:17,280
Three though

1625
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:24,192
Ask him how big the timestamp is

1626
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:25,984
Like attributes

1627
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:29,824
I think it's time-stamped because if I start

1628
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:33,152
Let me start starting right now

1629
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,968
Right now counting down so

1630
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:37,248
Starting

1631
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:39,296
Right

1632
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:42,368
Now I'm starting 9

1633
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:46,720
I just realize I need a timer to

1634
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:57,472
Starting when I goes

1635
02:36:57,728 --> 02:37:03,360
Oh whatever I'll stop at D2

1636
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:08,224
I'm pretty sure I'm right about the second

1637
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,248
B

1638
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:11,552
Maybe I'm Wrong maybe that is

1639
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:16,160
Jose that was 5.92 seconds

1640
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:22,560
And that would be the most significant find out of a 4 B

1641
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:26,400
B 1 b 2 B 3

1642
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:28,960
And that bit right there

1643
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:32,032
Success to death with you

1644
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,592
Is also switch out of

1645
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,664
Terrible mode

1646
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:40,480
Automatic

1647
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:41,248
Yeah there we go

1648
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:44,832
/ 48

1649
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:47,136
MHz

1650
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:54,048
5.59 seconds and the number on my phone is 5.9

1651
02:37:54,304 --> 02:38:00,448
Second I'm pretty confident about that

1652
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:02,752
From the beginning

1653
02:38:04,032 --> 02:38:10,176
So that's good moving on

1654
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:20,672
Tell me what those two r's how do I tell the difference in person so let's let's find out

1655
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:26,816
Going to take this off here I'm going to start pushing it on different ones and seeing what I see

1656
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:32,192
That's that one

1657
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:33,472
At 18

1658
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:35,264
30

1659
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:36,800
08

1660
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:38,336
10

1661
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,640
68

1662
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:42,432
70

1663
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,736
58

1664
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:54,464
How do I tell the difference

1665
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:57,024
Between an LED 88

1666
02:38:57,792 --> 02:38:58,816
And

1667
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:06,240
A number the length of the first pulse so 88 x is greater than 128

1668
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:09,824
So I don't know that it's an LED

1669
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:16,224
Hehe rb8

1670
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:22,624
That's significantly higher how would I know right there like it could bb8 and either way like

1671
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:35,424
So here's an example where this all breaks down

1672
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:41,824
There's something that I'm missing right here is a line where

1673
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:48,224
The codes are bb-8 which is which voted on here I'm looking at and then I know these

1674
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:54,624
Next to B are the time but how would I write a program that knows that means I'm missing some

1675
02:39:54,880 --> 02:40:01,024
Something I need to know how many LEDs are how many photodiode readings are being read in this message

1676
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:06,656
I don't know how to do that right now don't know how to do that

1677
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:09,472
How

1678
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,568
How am I going to do that

1679
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:18,432
Okay time to look at the rest of the data packet and let's see if we can get something from that

1680
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:25,088
Semonite Now display the whole data packet

1681
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:32,512
That didn't work why didn't that work

1682
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:35,840
How did work

1683
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,264
AAA

1684
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:45,056
Day date

1685
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:48,640
PA

1686
02:40:57,344 --> 02:41:01,184
Okay so now when I've done explain the whole data packet

1687
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:07,328
And this one right here remember how 88 it means I don't necessarily know whether it's in

1688
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:13,728
It is a Santa reading or if it's the first length of time that the sensor is on

1689
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:20,128
Going to go look in this message right here and see if I can glean some information from this message to see

1690
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,432
What I think it might be

1691
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:26,528
My first of all it's it's obvious that we have

1692
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:30,880
So this is the most significant fight

1693
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:34,208
Of the time

1694
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:35,232
S

1695
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:42,144
This one right here is what I think is the length of the actual packet

1696
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:44,192
This one is

1697
02:41:44,448 --> 02:41:50,592
The second the second next fight down and significance for time then

1698
02:41:50,848 --> 02:41:52,384
The LED codes

1699
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:55,712
But there could be more that are exactly the same

1700
02:41:58,016 --> 02:42:01,856
I'm afraid to use the length of the packet tell me how many there are

1701
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:04,416
Because what if

1702
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:06,976
Ami packets are really big

1703
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:14,144
Imagine you could have something where it was like

1704
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,704
Start code

1705
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:18,240
Very sorry

1706
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:22,080
Free LEDs that each have very small values and that would be

1707
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:28,736
34567 really long value

1708
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:32,320
And they would take up more room so I don't know if I can trust

1709
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:37,184
This right here to tell me how many pieces of data are in the message

1710
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:42,304
How do I know that there's three

1711
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:47,168
Pulses in this thing is anybody coming up with any helpful suggestions for this

1712
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:53,056
Does your purse from the back the ground examples rental, point where the number of

1713
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:56,896
Is equal to the number of fights not parts

1714
02:42:57,664 --> 02:42:59,712
Do you want to come over here and say that again or

1715
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:00,992
So I guess I should

1716
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:07,392
I can bring it up

1717
02:43:08,672 --> 02:43:14,816
Suggestions in the chat Charlie

1718
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:20,960
The bottom

1719
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:27,104
And then pop-out chat and then I put that on the side of your screen at all time okay

1720
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:31,712
This guy talking about dividing the the B you have

1721
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:33,760
Cyrus something I don't understand

1722
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:39,136
I want to feel really embarrassed if there's somebody in the chat who's already given all of these answers and

1723
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:41,952
I just wasn't reading visible

1724
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,584
Looks like

1725
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:53,472
Behind-the-scenes stuff going on here

1726
02:43:53,728 --> 02:43:56,032
See your recommendation is read

1727
02:43:56,288 --> 02:44:02,432
From behind to get the parts from the back to figure out how many samples are in it and you'll come to a point where number

1728
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:03,456
Spencer's

1729
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:07,808
Hit parsed is not as equal to number

1730
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:12,928
Hockey got to be a way of knowing

1731
02:44:19,328 --> 02:44:20,608
There's no way

1732
02:44:33,152 --> 02:44:36,224
Problem you're having this exact reason why

1733
02:44:40,064 --> 02:44:40,576
Yeah

1734
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:43,648
What did he say

1735
02:44:43,904 --> 02:44:50,048
Tell me how things exact reason why it's called something by directionally

1736
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:15,392
Oh my God are you serious

1737
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:20,512
Beginning is totally the Liang

1738
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:29,472
Okay okay fine you were right it's arcade oh my gosh

1739
02:45:39,712 --> 02:45:41,760
Okay

1740
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:44,832
Ears

1741
02:45:45,856 --> 02:45:52,000
Okay I don't know how many bytes in the back actually matter there are four extra-base I don't know what they do

1742
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:54,560
There are three B here

1743
02:45:55,328 --> 02:46:01,472
I'm guessing two of these B are sent to do with the the size of the

1744
02:46:03,264 --> 02:46:06,079
I'm sorry headphone users I was

1745
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:10,431
I was just really really

1746
02:46:14,527 --> 02:46:20,671
Anyway by the way if I do this like with my own stuff I'm totally using

1747
02:46:21,183 --> 02:46:27,327
The air 211 MC S7 like coding so I can have as many bits as I want and not have to worry about it

1748
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:33,727
Anything to you Speedy 266 and maybe with esp32 I don't know

1749
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:40,127
You can actually send just raw packets like a straight of radio and I have tested the esp8266 up to

1750
02:46:40,383 --> 02:46:46,527
The full MCS 772 mb per second standard and it just keeps up it's just that crazy so

1751
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:49,855
I'm totally sold on anywhere I can I'm shoving a little lot

1752
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:51,647
Esp8266

1753
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:59,071
Oh and rs.24 can't do that

1754
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:05,471
Beard pocket first thing that the nrf24 l01 started within the nordics

1755
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:09,055
That makes sense okay

1756
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:13,919
I'm so sorry you had to use the Nordic semi part

1757
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:19,295
Anyway

1758
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:21,343
Moving on

1759
02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:27,743
It's bidirectional encoded really there is nothing the beginning that I can look at night ride

1760
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:30,815
And been confirmed to tell in advance

1761
02:47:31,327 --> 02:47:32,351
How many

1762
02:47:32,607 --> 02:47:34,655
LEDs are going to be in the signal

1763
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:38,495
I wish I knew what these last four b r but I don't know what they are

1764
02:47:39,263 --> 02:47:41,055
These last two here

1765
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:45,919
Sasa 25 1234

1766
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:48,479
This is counting up continuously

1767
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:50,271
That's interesting

1768
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:53,087
I-69 be

1769
02:47:55,135 --> 02:47:57,183
980

1770
02:47:58,975 --> 02:48:00,767
Oh that's weird what's going on there

1771
02:48:04,607 --> 02:48:07,423
Might be the math but overcoming on your infection

1772
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:11,007
No stop giving me until I'm already ahead of the game

1773
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:18,943
Oh yeah okay

1774
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:25,343
Anyway

1775
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:34,303
Okay so let's see here I have 2174 1546 guessing that

1776
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:40,447
That's leftover bbc1 C60 this one is counting up all the time

1777
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:44,799
But that's interesting cuz bbc1 see text

1778
02:48:50,943 --> 02:48:56,319
Oh okay what kind of cool if you click the link just for the sake of being able to identify the different things apart

1779
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:00,415
Anyway

1780
02:49:02,719 --> 02:49:03,999
51

1781
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:05,791
Corresponds to

1782
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:07,327
Sorry there is

1783
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:08,351
5

1784
02:49:08,863 --> 02:49:12,447
Dfc90 where's the one that was incrementing

1785
02:49:13,727 --> 02:49:19,871
CCD 16cc

1786
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:26,271
CC does not correspond to

1787
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:28,319
Probably actually the second

1788
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:30,367
Most significant bit

1789
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:34,463
Okay so that was accounted for and now we have these other two

1790
02:49:34,975 --> 02:49:35,487
Which

1791
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:36,767
Add up

1792
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:40,863
So that would make it through that that gives us all four of the B

1793
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:47,519
That's kind of cool

1794
02:49:47,775 --> 02:49:53,919
123 that gives us all of the time signature if we start reading

1795
02:49:54,175 --> 02:50:00,319
Backwards then we can read out all of the okay fine whatever

1796
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:06,719
From a backwards yes then you told me I needed three more

1797
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:13,119
Okay so tell you now that you're here and you're a lot more open mouth and I thought you would be

1798
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:19,519
We pretty much saw the protocol now like I could I could go right this week

1799
02:50:19,775 --> 02:50:25,919
Test it but I'm I am serious wide give the second most significant fight in the time code

1800
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:32,319
Code for the message

1801
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:38,719
Significant b e r is that the code for the message

1802
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:45,119
Change the time code that the message received and not the time code for the OTA

1803
02:50:51,775 --> 02:50:57,919
The IMU b b you know what time you're making this a little

1804
02:50:58,175 --> 02:51:04,319
All the two easy so you're suggesting I throw out the MSP which is okay cuz I don't

1805
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:10,719
Okay well you just handed me the ranch

1806
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:17,119
A lot of fun today what I guess it's time to go

1807
02:51:17,375 --> 02:51:23,519
Code that up now that we have a pretty good understanding of it

1808
02:51:23,775 --> 02:51:29,919
See here so I have various functions for popping off bits of data I'm going to make one that's lb 25

1809
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:36,319
Minecon popper Arcane pop

1810
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:49,119
Forgot to make a function for I can pop I guess yeah

1811
02:51:49,375 --> 02:51:55,519
Into Arcane pop

1812
02:51:55,775 --> 02:52:01,919
He's our star data

1813
02:52:02,175 --> 02:52:08,319
And actually this is really weird so got to start from the back

1814
02:52:08,575 --> 02:52:14,719
Forward which is the opposite of the way that we normally process the data that's

1815
02:52:14,975 --> 02:52:21,119
Passive pointer to the end of string and read it

1816
02:52:21,375 --> 02:52:27,519
Backwards so

1817
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:33,919
Also I make sure I don't go off the front

1818
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:40,319
Let's see here that would be

1819
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:46,719
Actuate then second question

1820
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:53,119
Why why did the OT a Time codes correspond so closely to the IMU time codes in Leicester

1821
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:59,519
Oh okay baby off the same timer that kind of makes sense okay

1822
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:05,919
I'm good with that

1823
02:53:06,175 --> 02:53:12,319
4 a.m. I think I was up until a little

1824
02:53:12,575 --> 02:53:18,719
I was up trying to decode this anyway moving again

1825
02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:25,119
So what I'm going to do is going to take a look at the value at the end

1826
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:31,519
I'm going to say

1827
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:37,919
Daystar and I'm going to say and

1828
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:44,319
- -

1829
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:57,119
The second I thought I was going to

1830
02:53:57,375 --> 02:54:03,519
Be able to use and negative index in my array

1831
02:54:03,775 --> 02:54:09,919
Deprogrammers cuz we still have a possibility of negative indexes about once every four years I actually run into an opera

1832
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:16,319
Community where it makes sense to use negative indexes in my IRA

1833
02:54:16,575 --> 02:54:22,719
What a negative indexes in Python do

1834
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:29,119
Oh okay

1835
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:35,519
Top 10 python you can count backwards

1836
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:40,383
Yes

1837
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:45,247
Okay so for reading from the back

1838
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:48,831
An example of daa 003

1839
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:51,903
B&B reading po3 first

1840
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:54,719
And I would say

1841
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:57,791
Another example would be 78

1842
02:54:58,047 --> 02:55:00,095
I read the 03 first

1843
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:05,727
Do a nice realize this could have even longer value so I should be careful how I could this

1844
02:55:08,287 --> 02:55:11,103
I have to advance backwards one more

1845
02:55:11,615 --> 02:55:15,455
So if V1 and Erik Satie

1846
02:55:15,967 --> 02:55:17,247
Mom

1847
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,255
Okay

1848
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:36,703
So what I do now is I say if the numbers were going from the back of the string looking for words so I start here.

1849
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:38,239
03

1850
02:55:38,495 --> 02:55:44,639
1003 does not have the most significant it set so we know we need to read the next value

1851
02:55:44,895 --> 02:55:47,711
That one's there

1852
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:52,831
That'll be

1853
02:55:54,367 --> 02:56:00,511
We need to read the next one so v-nam or equal schools

1854
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:04,863
Remove it up seven bit because it's

1855
02:56:05,119 --> 02:56:08,703
Did the size of these things is 1 - its first it tells us yeah

1856
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:10,751
Or

1857
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:13,567
Star and

1858
02:56:17,919 --> 02:56:18,943
Okay

1859
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:32,767
Save this number

1860
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:56,319
Is the

1861
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:00,927
I'm curious what it

1862
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:04,767
What did I say that that Ben said the funny thing to

1863
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:25,759
How you know what

1864
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:53,407
Shenzhen IO

1865
02:57:54,175 --> 02:58:00,319
Someone mentioned that you were basically doing Irish and don't know what is that I don't know what channel

1866
02:58:00,575 --> 02:58:03,903
Review about machine language

1867
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:04,927
Oh cool

1868
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:09,279
This isn't the game though

1869
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:14,911
It's like Canada

1870
02:58:15,167 --> 02:58:17,983
If you die in Canada you die in real life

1871
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:28,991
Okay so what I'm doing is I'm whatever I'm never going to read more than a number

1872
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:33,343
Yo whatever I'll just let the whole thing fly so I look at the

1873
02:58:39,743 --> 02:58:42,559
I look at the B that we're currently on

1874
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:45,887
And I said v-nam this is like my accumulator

1875
02:58:47,679 --> 02:58:48,959
Call the accumulator

1876
02:58:49,471 --> 02:58:52,543
To be that value-added with lower bitmask

1877
02:58:53,055 --> 02:58:59,199
And so this would read out 03 and set it to the accumulator and Advance the pointer one back

1878
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:03,551
Then

1879
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:05,343
If

1880
02:59:06,111 --> 02:59:12,255
15 on the number that was actually red has a 178 that we know we're done we stop we have

1881
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:14,303
The number we needed we need to get out

1882
02:59:14,559 --> 02:59:16,351
I'm so we returned the accumulator

1883
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:20,703
If not then we read the next value

1884
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:22,495
We advance the pointer back

1885
02:59:29,919 --> 02:59:31,455
Am I missing something in the chat

1886
02:59:34,527 --> 02:59:37,087
And immediately read the next value out

1887
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,623
And you know

1888
02:59:39,135 --> 02:59:42,719
Let's also say if it's if the flag is set

1889
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:44,767
Or

1890
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:47,583
We have

1891
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:52,959
Orenda sequel to start

1892
02:59:53,215 --> 02:59:57,567
Set means we can't just jump off the beginning of the actual vector and we can't cause problems

1893
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:01,919
Getting flashbacks right inspection

1894
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:08,575
So sorry for you then

1895
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,255
How did I get

1896
03:00:17,535 --> 03:00:18,303
Forgot

1897
03:00:19,327 --> 03:00:20,863
Rug burn or something at some point

1898
03:00:26,495 --> 03:00:30,079
There's no way I can be more than four B I'll just return the accumulator there

1899
03:00:34,175 --> 03:00:35,967
I guess it could be more than four B

1900
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:40,575
I'm not going to code that

1901
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:42,111
Anyway

1902
03:00:43,647 --> 03:00:45,183
So Arcane Popcaan

1903
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:48,767
Go to the end of the string and start popping back

1904
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:50,559
Okay

1905
03:00:51,839 --> 03:00:53,375
So in here

1906
03:00:56,959 --> 03:00:57,727
Parse

1907
03:00:57,983 --> 03:00:59,775
What's wrong with this thing well

1908
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:03,359
What's go for the gold

1909
03:01:26,143 --> 03:01:32,287
Time 1

1910
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:38,943
Makes me nervous to do now

1911
03:01:56,095 --> 03:02:02,239
7 B back from the end of the packet

1912
03:02:02,495 --> 03:02:08,639
Forgot to mention the last four B actually not in the payload what happened

1913
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:15,039
When was that I noticed when I was looking at the data that there were four bites that kept changing I didn't know what they were I thought they were CRC

1914
03:02:15,295 --> 03:02:18,111
I tried a bunch of stuff and couldn't figure it out

1915
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:24,511
So I was printing it out anyway because they might have been part of the code but they were

1916
03:02:24,767 --> 03:02:30,911
Completely useless so has been confirmed they very well may be

1917
03:02:32,191 --> 03:02:36,031
So end is equal to

1918
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:39,359
Creed

1919
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:42,431
Date now yeah read data

1920
03:02:42,943 --> 03:02:45,503
Q t y -1

1921
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:49,599
My time is

1922
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:51,391
And

1923
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:55,231
0

1924
03:02:58,047 --> 03:03:00,351
That

1925
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:01,375
Yes

1926
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:09,823
Up 24 and 1 or so

1927
03:03:10,079 --> 03:03:16,223
-1 of 60

1928
03:03:16,479 --> 03:03:20,575
4 + -2

1929
03:03:22,111 --> 03:03:23,391
8 no wait

1930
03:03:24,415 --> 03:03:26,207
16

1931
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:28,255
It

1932
03:03:31,327 --> 03:03:37,471
Okay that's probably the time maybe maybe not I don't know

1933
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:42,335
Now let's start Arcane popping our way back to the beginning

1934
03:03:42,591 --> 03:03:46,687
While and is not equal to

1935
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:50,527
T-star

1936
03:03:50,783 --> 03:03:52,575
Start equals

1937
03:03:54,623 --> 03:03:56,159
Free data

1938
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:34,047
How am I know I'm not talking much but I am a man and by definition very bad at

1939
03:04:34,303 --> 03:04:36,863
Multitasking

1940
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:40,447
AC Popa

1941
03:04:48,127 --> 03:04:49,919
Yeah

1942
03:04:50,175 --> 03:04:56,319
Okay so while we're not we just pop off a bunch of numbers and let's just see what we get

1943
03:04:56,575 --> 03:05:01,439
We got a compiler whoops

1944
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:16,287
This makes pointer from Magic House without

1945
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:32,415
How we didn't crash let's see if these data points make sense

1946
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:34,975
Okay

1947
03:05:37,023 --> 03:05:41,887
Time is 100/66 297

1948
03:05:42,143 --> 03:05:45,983
Is a reasonable number as far as numbers go

1949
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:48,543
Starting from the back

1950
03:05:49,055 --> 03:05:53,407
19 19 19 6

1951
03:05:54,431 --> 03:05:58,783
196 33 70

1952
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:02,623
That does not look right

1953
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:11,327
Definitely 707070 B3

1954
03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:13,119
02

1955
03:06:23,103 --> 03:06:28,479
What's the what's also print out what we were looking at before so we can compare them

1956
03:06:39,487 --> 03:06:42,047
Holding up the little light thing now

1957
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:45,631
I know Italy format this a little bit better too

1958
03:06:56,639 --> 03:07:02,783
Okay so for this code right here the packet looks like this

1959
03:07:03,039 --> 03:07:05,343
We know the last four B don't matter

1960
03:07:05,599 --> 03:07:11,231
We have 12 3/4 the time code which produces this time code right here

1961
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:14,047
Then we read off 0 to 90

1962
03:07:14,303 --> 03:07:18,143
Switch is not 001

1963
03:07:18,399 --> 03:07:20,959
Not at all

1964
03:07:23,519 --> 03:07:25,823
Not at all

1965
03:07:28,127 --> 03:07:30,431
What am I doing wrong

1966
03:07:34,783 --> 03:07:38,111
Okay so I got

1967
03:07:38,367 --> 03:07:39,391
Reading the end

1968
03:07:59,103 --> 03:08:00,639
I'm not sending my pointer dent

1969
03:08:00,895 --> 03:08:02,943
Properly before first pop

1970
03:08:05,503 --> 03:08:09,087
I have a suspicion that might be it let me just do this and all off

1971
03:08:09,343 --> 03:08:11,135
I'll just confirm

1972
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:17,791
So I'm reading at the end the 8th

1973
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:22,655
Oh yep you're right I'm deathly not doing that right

1974
03:08:22,911 --> 03:08:27,007
That would be in the middle of what I care about this one too far so

1975
03:08:28,031 --> 03:08:30,847
And should be quantity - 2

1976
03:08:33,663 --> 03:08:36,735
Thank you whoever that was who was it that was

1977
03:08:37,247 --> 03:08:40,319
Night Nightwing

1978
03:08:40,831 --> 03:08:42,111
Arthritis

1979
03:08:42,367 --> 03:08:44,159
What's the date

1980
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:48,767
1760

1981
03:09:00,543 --> 03:09:02,591
1234

1982
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:06,431
Now I still wrong if its -3

1983
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:07,967
23

1984
03:09:09,247 --> 03:09:12,575
4 - 4 - 4

1985
03:09:16,671 --> 03:09:18,719
Okay

1986
03:09:19,487 --> 03:09:23,583
302 a002 read that

1987
03:09:25,887 --> 03:09:28,703
Nea 0 okay that's good

1988
03:09:32,543 --> 03:09:36,383
01 9002a 1

1989
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:38,175
But

1990
03:09:39,199 --> 03:09:45,343
These numbers don't look right so ei0101 should not be

1991
03:09:49,183 --> 03:09:51,743
Or 280

1992
03:09:52,511 --> 03:09:55,071
Yeah that that number coming out is just wrong

1993
03:09:56,095 --> 03:09:57,887
Trisomy wrong in here

1994
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:07,871
So what in the world

1995
03:10:31,935 --> 03:10:33,471
Take a look at this

1996
03:10:40,127 --> 03:10:43,199
Entertain pop that's right

1997
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:50,879
122 that would be the right value for so right now reading back 02

1998
03:10:51,135 --> 03:10:55,487
280 it should be 120 hacks that's right

1999
03:10:55,743 --> 03:11:01,119
But when I print it out it's 00020 why is

2000
03:11:03,167 --> 03:11:07,007
I'm sending to you and 8

2001
03:11:08,287 --> 03:11:10,847
Make it a 32

2002
03:11:12,639 --> 03:11:14,175
Try that

2003
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:18,015
Gorgeous

2004
03:11:19,039 --> 03:11:20,063
Okay

2005
03:11:20,575 --> 03:11:22,367
That's that's really happy

2006
03:11:25,951 --> 03:11:32,095
Go remove some of these extra printouts here that we definitely don't need anymore

2007
03:11:37,215 --> 03:11:41,823
Chelsea Otis says so now we're starting at the end here

2008
03:11:46,175 --> 03:11:50,527
Caesura 290 is 11

2009
03:11:51,295 --> 03:11:52,831
11e which is correct

2010
03:11:53,087 --> 03:11:59,231
VR 9201 is just 92 hacks 029 1:30

2011
03:12:00,511 --> 03:12:01,535
Anyone hacks

2012
03:12:02,303 --> 03:12:04,095
134

2013
03:12:11,007 --> 03:12:15,871
Oh we'll know we're done when we've read

2014
03:12:22,271 --> 03:12:23,807
So we have

2015
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:30,463
We have 1 2 3 4 5 numbers which is length of time the distance between time

2016
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:36,863
Distance between distance between time no distance so we have five numbers that

2017
03:12:37,119 --> 03:12:39,679
Will mean we need have three lighting events

2018
03:12:40,959 --> 03:12:43,007
And then if we do if there's three more bites

2019
03:12:43,263 --> 03:12:47,871
Left at the beginning of the packet we know we're good to go let's try parsing.

2020
03:13:07,839 --> 03:13:12,447
Whoever you fell be on the safe side

2021
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:23,967
Equals the number of sensor that's right that's unfortunately

2022
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:28,063
Yes I said that but he probably already said in chat so he's a little bit faster than me

2023
03:13:29,855 --> 03:13:35,999
Then I'm just so you know I'm not pulling the 24-hour one traffic and we just found out it's not the 24 LOL

2024
03:13:36,255 --> 03:13:42,399
I want anyway what's happening is the

2025
03:13:45,471 --> 03:13:51,615
And I'm using all of the USB commands to go

2026
03:13:51,871 --> 03:13:56,223
Connect to Vista Wireless version and pull the data off

2027
03:13:56,479 --> 03:14:01,599
Something else

2028
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:10,559
Why use heat rather than control messages because

2029
03:14:10,815 --> 03:14:16,959
Ever since even low-speed USB you can usually get better performance from the control meth

2030
03:14:17,215 --> 03:14:23,359
Messages when you have really tight time constraint you don't have to answer that but

2031
03:14:23,615 --> 03:14:29,759
It's something a lot of people do a lot of people use the his stuff or the interrupt mechanisms instead of can

2032
03:14:30,015 --> 03:14:31,039
Control mechanism

2033
03:14:31,295 --> 03:14:32,831
I just never

2034
03:14:33,343 --> 03:14:36,415
Never really understood why

2035
03:14:36,671 --> 03:14:41,279
So if you do want to comment on it great if you don't want to comment totally understand

2036
03:14:44,607 --> 03:14:48,191
Is it clearly there's something I'm missing I don't understand why it's done that way but

2037
03:14:49,471 --> 03:14:51,775
Heartplace is

2038
03:14:52,031 --> 03:14:53,055
0

2039
03:14:53,311 --> 03:14:55,103
AC pop

2040
03:14:55,615 --> 03:14:59,711
Parameters I equals car

2041
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:03,807
Fireplace plus is equal to AC pop

2042
03:15:16,351 --> 03:15:22,495
No I'm not making custom firmware for the guard

2043
03:15:22,751 --> 03:15:28,895
Oh my gosh if you are willing to tell me I cannot get

2044
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:35,295
The haptics to work reliably when I enter it it something like really quick

2045
03:15:35,551 --> 03:15:39,903
It doesn't feel or sound good but you know whatever

2046
03:15:43,999 --> 03:15:48,351
Going back to this now we got to actually make forward progress the purpose of this is to

2047
03:15:48,607 --> 03:15:51,679
Reverse engineering anymore like I'm just

2048
03:15:51,935 --> 03:15:56,287
Whatever we're implementing something we did some reverse engineering

2049
03:15:57,823 --> 03:16:03,967
And Mindy is still reverse-engineering the the firmware is

2050
03:16:10,623 --> 03:16:14,207
Okay

2051
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:32,639
So what is the equation for this we're going to be looking for a situation in which

2052
03:16:34,431 --> 03:16:38,527
Does anyone else I'm really bad at this kind of logic I am the math dolt

2053
03:16:45,183 --> 03:16:51,327
I do not need a chair anyone else can you think of this cuz I'm having a really hard time

2054
03:16:51,583 --> 03:16:57,727
It's par plate the number of parameters / greater than

2055
03:17:04,383 --> 03:17:10,527
Okay I will take a copy and paste of what you just told me and keep it for later

2056
03:17:17,183 --> 03:17:23,327
Ben Jackson says

2057
03:17:23,583 --> 03:17:29,727
Anyway I going to this little bit more

2058
03:17:29,983 --> 03:17:36,127
Light code that is par place over to so we have

2059
03:17:49,183 --> 03:17:51,743
Be

2060
03:17:57,119 --> 03:18:03,263
53 flashes one

2061
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:04,799
Opposite one

2062
03:18:05,311 --> 03:18:08,383
2

2063
03:18:09,919 --> 03:18:11,199
3

2064
03:18:11,455 --> 03:18:13,759
4

2065
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:17,087
5

2066
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:24,255
If I have 53 messages here

2067
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:27,583
Good fall I have is one message

2068
03:18:27,839 --> 03:18:31,679
I would expect one light

2069
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:35,007
So

2070
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:37,311
If

2071
03:18:39,103 --> 03:18:40,895
Our place

2072
03:18:41,663 --> 03:18:44,991
I'll be 35 -

2073
03:18:45,247 --> 03:18:51,391
5 / 2

2074
03:18:51,647 --> 03:18:55,231
5 + 1 / 2

2075
03:18:55,487 --> 03:19:01,631
Is equal to place the v65i 23

2076
03:19:01,887 --> 03:19:08,031
Hip replaced three okay got it so par place

2077
03:19:08,287 --> 03:19:14,431
+ 1/2 is less than or equal to

2078
03:19:14,687 --> 03:19:15,711
Remain

2079
03:19:17,247 --> 03:19:19,295
Now if it's

2080
03:19:20,575 --> 03:19:22,111
Greater than

2081
03:19:22,367 --> 03:19:28,511
Prequel to remain then we're going to break out of the loop

2082
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:50,015
This means something went wrong

2083
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:13,823
Otherwise we probably have a good packet

2084
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:43,167
Okay so now this is annoying cuz

2085
03:21:43,423 --> 03:21:49,567
We got to read them from the back going forward

2086
03:21:49,823 --> 03:21:55,967
Okay so let's make sure that we actually know the order we're reading this all in but I'm going to do is I'm going

2087
03:21:56,223 --> 03:22:02,367
2in DVR program I'm going to sit at 225 2015 and

2088
03:22:02,623 --> 03:22:08,767
When I said it to 8 + 16

2089
03:22:21,823 --> 03:22:27,967
I can't get access to that so surely in here

2090
03:23:00,223 --> 03:23:06,367
Now we're Cookin it's hold us up to here

2091
03:23:06,623 --> 03:23:12,767
But let's see what the data says

2092
03:23:13,023 --> 03:23:19,167
Oh you know what

2093
03:23:25,823 --> 03:23:31,967
20-20-20

2094
03:23:32,223 --> 03:23:38,367
G502 9401

2095
03:23:38,623 --> 03:23:44,767
Find CO2 in 601

2096
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:51,167
BO2

2097
03:23:57,823 --> 03:24:03,967
Oh you know what I didn't reprogram DVR

2098
03:24:07,039 --> 03:24:13,183
Bellator 228

2099
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:15,743
Fl1a 102

2100
03:24:17,279 --> 03:24:22,911
The 1020 is increasing the delay and

2101
03:24:27,007 --> 03:24:31,615
You know what let's figure out why the washing counters matching I figure that other part out later

2102
03:24:47,743 --> 03:24:49,535
Anyone else noticed the problem of my code

2103
03:25:00,287 --> 03:25:05,407
You're just giving it away now okay

2104
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:25,887
Describe there

2105
03:25:26,143 --> 03:25:28,447
And -2 deltas

2106
03:25:31,775 --> 03:25:33,055
Yes I have

2107
03:25:48,671 --> 03:25:54,815
So 2836 4452

2108
03:25:55,071 --> 03:25:56,095
Why

2109
03:25:58,655 --> 03:26:04,031
Oh the number of B remaining is this minus this plus one

2110
03:26:29,375 --> 03:26:32,191
I don't really want to do that

2111
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:40,895
Maybe I do

2112
03:26:47,551 --> 03:26:49,087
Hey why don't you match

2113
03:27:07,007 --> 03:27:10,335
52 why didn't you pull off a third

2114
03:27:31,583 --> 03:27:32,095
How is it

2115
03:27:33,375 --> 03:27:35,679
I do while logic was wrong

2116
03:27:41,823 --> 03:27:44,639
Okay pulled off the data

2117
03:28:02,047 --> 03:28:04,607
Sorry Charles Foreman

2118
03:28:13,567 --> 03:28:17,663
Okay so that's the right number of parameters

2119
03:28:26,623 --> 03:28:32,767
Direct time is the first edge of the first hit

2120
03:28:33,023 --> 03:28:38,911
And we just figured out that the first hit is the first one here so this one here is hit number one

2121
03:28:40,703 --> 03:28:42,495
Sorry that whatever the first

2122
03:28:42,751 --> 03:28:45,823
Logical hit which is at the end of our list cuz

2123
03:28:47,103 --> 03:28:48,127
Whatever

2124
03:28:48,639 --> 03:28:50,687
Totally did this all backwards

2125
03:31:03,295 --> 03:31:04,575
Oh

2126
03:31:08,415 --> 03:31:12,511
I'm actually one step to not here

2127
03:31:55,519 --> 03:31:56,799
They Mindy decide

2128
03:32:03,967 --> 03:32:07,295
Anymore

2129
03:32:38,015 --> 03:32:41,599
What is a live here

2130
03:32:46,463 --> 03:32:50,047
This is going to get very meta very

2131
03:32:50,815 --> 03:32:51,583
Very meta

2132
03:32:52,095 --> 03:32:55,935
I wonder how long it will take before I can put this together and can actually like

2133
03:32:56,959 --> 03:32:59,007
Recoup around

2134
03:32:59,775 --> 03:33:01,823
Stay here

2135
03:33:02,079 --> 03:33:02,847
There goes

2136
03:33:04,127 --> 03:33:08,735
Okay

2137
03:33:11,551 --> 03:33:13,087
Goes my time

2138
03:33:18,719 --> 03:33:20,255
Handle lightcap

2139
03:33:25,119 --> 03:33:26,399
W

2140
03:33:27,423 --> 03:33:28,447
Genuflection

2141
03:33:40,223 --> 03:33:44,319
Working on phone

2142
03:33:45,087 --> 03:33:51,231
I think we have been hasn't said anything

2143
03:34:18,879 --> 03:34:19,903
Close

2144
03:34:23,743 --> 03:34:29,119
Then proper size Hungarian experiments to break it on

2145
03:34:31,167 --> 03:34:35,007
Okay then I got to work fast enough

2146
03:34:35,263 --> 03:34:41,407
Tcmsp from the packet

2147
03:34:41,663 --> 03:34:45,247
Princess watch

2148
03:34:48,063 --> 03:34:54,207
Ben says he's going to experiment that will break it

2149
03:34:54,463 --> 03:34:56,255
Cmsv from the packet

2150
03:34:58,047 --> 03:35:00,863
That won't work cuz it's going to be at the edge

2151
03:35:01,119 --> 03:35:07,263
What is the time code is right on the edge and the thing from previous

2152
03:35:08,287 --> 03:35:11,359
MSP lover

2153
03:35:55,647 --> 03:36:01,791
Okay so that's one other thing that I did forget to mention I do have a function handle lightcap so anytime

2154
03:36:02,047 --> 03:36:08,191
Time did the centers received anywhere I do all of the stuff to determine whether or not it's a code from

2155
03:36:08,447 --> 03:36:14,591
The lighthouse or the code internally and I do the stuff to sweep

2156
03:36:14,847 --> 03:36:20,735
Or The Flash and I also do the stuff too so what we get is we get the time of the

2157
03:36:20,991 --> 03:36:27,135
First Edge what we really need is the time at the middle and that's how we can figure

2158
03:36:27,391 --> 03:36:32,255
That that metal thing out I noticed I'm not sure if we will really work

2159
03:36:32,511 --> 03:36:37,375
But I'm pretty sure we actually need to sample at 24 MHz

2160
03:36:37,631 --> 03:36:40,703
Because then we can back out in advance before sending

2161
03:36:40,959 --> 03:36:47,103
What's beginning would be based on the beginning and Edge edges of the beginning and closing it to the packet

2162
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:53,503
848 granularity of 48 Mega samples for S we can actually sample at 24 samples for

2163
03:36:53,759 --> 03:36:57,087
2nd and that's a lot easier to do on the esp32 so

2164
03:36:57,599 --> 03:37:02,719
Ha4d is not divisible by 48 we could totally do it at 40 and then divide 2

2165
03:37:03,231 --> 03:37:04,255
Yeah anyway

2166
03:37:05,279 --> 03:37:09,631
So I'm just going to pass this data into the handle lightcap function

2167
03:37:10,911 --> 03:37:13,471
Panini to advance the time to

2168
03:37:13,983 --> 03:37:15,775
The next one after

2169
03:37:31,391 --> 03:37:32,671
Think that's correct

2170
03:37:33,439 --> 03:37:35,743
Logic might be totally wrong but

2171
03:38:14,399 --> 03:38:20,543
Is Ellie. Type I just don't remember she really look that up

2172
03:38:20,799 --> 03:38:26,943
Oh

2173
03:38:27,199 --> 03:38:33,343
Actually Ellie type has got to be

2174
03:38:33,599 --> 03:38:39,743
Valid

2175
03:38:39,999 --> 03:38:46,143
Ellie. Type

2176
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:52,543
But that is your wife

2177
03:38:59,199 --> 03:39:05,343
Let's just do the clever thing right now to get the most significant fight of the the time

2178
03:39:05,599 --> 03:39:11,743
Timecode

2179
03:39:56,799 --> 03:40:02,943
So what I'm doing is I'm going to copy the most significant fight from the IMU time

2180
03:40:03,199 --> 03:40:09,343
Loaded into TGIF and then if it's small great if it's

2181
03:40:09,599 --> 03:40:15,743
Then I'm going to need to bump it up or bump it down one so if T diff

2182
03:40:15,999 --> 03:40:22,143
Is greater than ffffff

2183
03:40:22,399 --> 03:40:28,543
7 and he'd if -2 equals

2184
03:41:00,799 --> 03:41:06,943
Okay

2185
03:41:07,199 --> 03:41:13,343
Leon I don't need to print out all that date anymore

2186
03:41:13,599 --> 03:41:19,743
Unplug

2187
03:41:19,999 --> 03:41:26,143
I find it hard to believe that I need to pump plus that much

2188
03:41:32,799 --> 03:41:38,943
Can hear your sneeze is okay

2189
03:41:39,199 --> 03:41:45,343
Yeah still one of the things you guys can't hear is that Adam is in

2190
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:51,743
The room over there

2191
03:41:51,999 --> 03:41:58,143
An echo of several seconds later

2192
03:41:58,399 --> 03:42:04,543
Anyone else in the channel should I be paying attention to

2193
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:10,943
Someone else about your educational guy answer phone

2194
03:42:11,199 --> 03:42:17,343
Someone that's going to get there

2195
03:42:23,999 --> 03:42:30,143
Wait what no no no no no job at Java bad JavaScript okay but only if you know see first

2196
03:42:36,799 --> 03:42:42,943
This is clearly wrong

2197
03:42:50,879 --> 03:42:52,159
Little engine

2198
03:42:56,255 --> 03:42:59,327
The Jackson just like jabberwock where's makes people flip

2199
03:43:23,903 --> 03:43:28,255
Okay

2200
03:43:28,511 --> 03:43:30,303
I'll take a look here

2201
03:43:31,071 --> 03:43:34,911
That's a much larger number than I would have expected

2202
03:43:36,447 --> 03:43:41,311
Hello came from than 145 6894

2203
03:43:49,503 --> 03:43:51,807
What's 30 milliseconds

2204
03:43:52,575 --> 03:43:54,111
Seems really big

2205
03:43:58,975 --> 03:44:00,255
Seems too big

2206
03:44:02,047 --> 03:44:04,351
Vader really that far out a day

2207
03:44:09,727 --> 03:44:11,007
Something wrong

2208
03:44:46,079 --> 03:44:47,871
Something about this is just wrong

2209
03:45:20,127 --> 03:45:23,199
I'm doing something wrong what is what is up with this

2210
03:46:15,935 --> 03:46:22,079
Sorry I'm just going back and looking through these

2211
03:46:22,335 --> 03:46:28,479
Let me know not sure why it's busted

2212
03:46:28,735 --> 03:46:34,879
I'm pulling up here I think

2213
03:46:35,135 --> 03:46:41,279
It's weird too cuz it is tracking pretty good

2214
03:46:41,535 --> 03:46:47,679
No it's not

2215
03:46:54,335 --> 03:47:00,479
No that's wrong

2216
03:47:07,135 --> 03:47:13,279
Yeah there's definitely something hosed

2217
03:47:22,751 --> 03:47:28,895
Charles beautiful when asking about the car

2218
03:47:29,151 --> 03:47:35,295
Quadcopter and positioning system videos

2219
03:47:35,551 --> 03:47:38,367
What

2220
03:47:38,623 --> 03:47:40,415
Quadcopter imposition mean

2221
03:47:40,671 --> 03:47:41,183
Stop

2222
03:47:43,743 --> 03:47:44,767
I will go sailing

2223
03:47:46,303 --> 03:47:49,375
I never even thought to put an ESPN

2224
03:47:49,887 --> 03:47:56,031
To use this with an ESP tell where it is with a quadcopter in 3D space that sounds like the cool

2225
03:47:56,287 --> 03:48:02,431
Coolest thing ever I don't know but I could make

2226
03:48:02,687 --> 03:48:08,831
Can do one although I did actually make a new quadcopter motherboard that I still totally knock on the pro

2227
03:48:09,087 --> 03:48:13,695
Programming that used to be a speedy 285 so it's even smaller yet

2228
03:48:16,255 --> 03:48:18,559
Whatever

2229
03:48:21,887 --> 03:48:27,519
Still wrong shopping from 64 to 281

2230
03:49:17,951 --> 03:49:20,767
And what about positioning playing the person masks

2231
03:49:23,839 --> 03:49:24,607
Tobacco

2232
03:49:25,631 --> 03:49:28,703
Why don't know what they're referring to positioning thing

2233
03:49:28,959 --> 03:49:35,103
But the positioning system

2234
03:49:38,175 --> 03:49:44,319
But I am going to be still tinkering with it so this here isn't esp32 on a circuit

2235
03:49:44,575 --> 03:49:45,343
Ford I designed

2236
03:49:45,599 --> 03:49:51,487
And I having problems getting it to work at all as you can see I have a bunch of wires trying to figure out why the Flash doesn't go

2237
03:49:51,743 --> 03:49:57,887
So this guy right here is hopefully my tempted that because down the ethernet port

2238
03:49:58,143 --> 03:50:04,287
On this board I can actually influence the Clock Crystal so I'm just going to see total Shot in the Dark

2239
03:50:04,543 --> 03:50:10,687
Any papers probably won't work maybe I can synchronize all of these exactly the same clock and then be able to tell all of that from

2240
03:50:10,943 --> 03:50:17,087
Granted there's a lot of Reflections and stuff like that so I could totally hoes my data but I have

2241
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:18,111
I've never let

2242
03:50:18,367 --> 03:50:24,511
Like actual science that tells me something is impossible from stopping me from

2243
03:50:24,767 --> 03:50:25,791
Trying it anyway

2244
03:50:26,047 --> 03:50:27,583
Because sometimes

2245
03:50:27,839 --> 03:50:32,191
People's understanding of science is wrong and it's worth trying it

2246
03:50:33,215 --> 03:50:38,079
Has he got the free time which I don't have but I do have sleep which I can cut into

2247
03:50:41,663 --> 03:50:47,551
Speaking of which like I have to do a v tomorrow at church so I got to be up at a reasonable time but

2248
03:50:47,807 --> 03:50:50,879
Don't need to be very well rested so

2249
03:50:53,183 --> 03:50:55,999
I need to do the things but I don't need to be prepared

2250
03:50:59,327 --> 03:51:01,119
Some definitely

2251
03:51:01,375 --> 03:51:03,167
Is wrong

2252
03:51:04,447 --> 03:51:05,983
+ 0 y

2253
03:51:08,799 --> 03:51:10,591
Look at the post date again

2254
03:51:36,447 --> 03:51:39,263
Oh I am still try the other way

2255
03:51:44,383 --> 03:51:46,687
Nobody has any ideas about why my codes busted

2256
03:51:49,759 --> 03:51:51,551
Obvious

2257
03:51:53,343 --> 03:51:55,903
Charles can you program nana nana nana

2258
03:52:00,511 --> 03:52:03,583
Actually I just realized backwards hubby

2259
03:52:04,863 --> 03:52:07,935
- 1 - 2 - 3

2260
03:52:08,703 --> 03:52:09,471
1

2261
03:52:09,727 --> 03:52:10,239
2

2262
03:52:11,519 --> 03:52:12,031
3

2263
03:52:31,487 --> 03:52:35,583
So why am I pulling off cao2 OB all wrong

2264
03:52:36,351 --> 03:52:38,655
He is positive

2265
03:52:42,495 --> 03:52:45,311
How are things going

2266
03:52:45,567 --> 03:52:50,175
Oh I'm reading the Matrix inversion

2267
03:52:51,455 --> 03:52:52,223
I think

2268
03:52:52,991 --> 03:52:55,039
It's going to be lying right now

2269
03:52:55,295 --> 03:52:58,623
So this is going to be a 9 by 9

2270
03:52:59,135 --> 03:53:01,695
Which means we can do it really fast

2271
03:53:03,487 --> 03:53:09,631
Libra is attempting to do it using

2272
03:53:11,167 --> 03:53:11,679
Like

2273
03:53:12,447 --> 03:53:18,591
Really naive updates were just kind of like drags the model around maybe that's good enough

2274
03:53:19,103 --> 03:53:22,431
But I really I don't know I really can't wait to see you at the

2275
03:53:22,943 --> 03:53:29,087
What the actual Kalman filter

2276
03:53:29,343 --> 03:53:31,391
Even necessary because

2277
03:53:32,159 --> 03:53:35,999
Because we were looking at some of the position data from the headset before

2278
03:53:36,767 --> 03:53:38,559
And it was really really

2279
03:53:39,583 --> 03:53:40,863
It looked really

2280
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:48,543
Not going to come over here

2281
03:53:48,799 --> 03:53:51,103
What

2282
03:53:51,615 --> 03:53:57,759
I was just saying I don't really know if we need us common filter cuz we were looking at the

2283
03:53:58,015 --> 03:54:04,159
Headset data and we weren't able to figure out the exact coordinate system but when we moved it a little bit of

2284
03:54:04,415 --> 03:54:10,559
Really really smooth and I went when we kept it completely stationary we saw a little bit

2285
03:54:10,815 --> 03:54:16,959
Noise in the timestamp then when we compared that the amount of noise versus

2286
03:54:17,215 --> 03:54:21,567
Motion over like a couple of inches

2287
03:54:21,823 --> 03:54:22,847
You couldn't

2288
03:54:23,103 --> 03:54:29,247
I couldn't see any noise in it at all so I don't I mean

2289
03:54:31,295 --> 03:54:32,063
We don't need it

2290
03:54:33,855 --> 03:54:35,647
Queen

2291
03:54:35,903 --> 03:54:42,047
I want to see what would happen if we do it right

2292
03:55:26,591 --> 03:55:27,871
Maybe that's right

2293
03:56:13,695 --> 03:56:19,583
Cuz what I'm looking at right here

2294
03:56:19,839 --> 03:56:25,983
The last for the CRC then it's 123 and it looks like 93 to F10

2295
03:56:26,239 --> 03:56:32,383
And that looks correct the marketing

2296
03:56:39,039 --> 03:56:45,183
I'm probably going to freak it out so that's.

2297
03:56:51,839 --> 03:56:57,983
Not able to

2298
03:58:16,831 --> 03:58:22,975
Still looks wrong

2299
03:58:46,783 --> 03:58:52,927
How do I make my time scale

2300
03:58:53,183 --> 03:58:55,231
The rack the time scale

2301
03:59:31,583 --> 03:59:37,727
Actors that

2302
03:59:37,983 --> 03:59:44,127
I thought the IMU and the lights would be

2303
03:59:44,383 --> 03:59:47,455
Be on the same time scale

2304
03:59:47,711 --> 03:59:49,503
And it appears they're not

2305
03:59:49,759 --> 03:59:55,903
Why could you not have used the same clock for both.

2306
04:00:02,559 --> 04:00:08,703
I would have made it so much easier

2307
04:00:11,007 --> 04:00:17,151
Now I got to go pee clever in stuff

2308
04:00:18,943 --> 04:00:25,087
Blastoise

2309
04:01:00,671 --> 04:01:06,815
I guess I can just treat everything is a 24-bit number

2310
04:01:51,615 --> 04:01:56,991
No I bought something

2311
04:02:34,111 --> 04:02:37,695
Oh I was wrong

2312
04:02:45,887 --> 04:02:52,031
Gorgeously

2313
04:02:54,847 --> 04:02:57,919
Indian Miss would that be

2314
04:02:58,943 --> 04:03:02,527
The bite at

2315
04:03:02,783 --> 04:03:08,927
Most significant

2316
04:03:09,183 --> 04:03:15,327
The number in the whole system then

2317
04:03:15,583 --> 04:03:19,423
I think so I think that's it

2318
04:03:19,679 --> 04:03:22,495
Looks better

2319
04:03:22,751 --> 04:03:25,567
Well is that really going up nicely or

2320
04:03:28,383 --> 04:03:30,943
Numbers too big to be going up nicely

2321
04:03:34,527 --> 04:03:37,855
Now wait maybe

2322
04:03:39,647 --> 04:03:45,535
How big is that 123456789 3 billion.

2323
04:03:47,583 --> 04:03:53,215
It is right bb60

2324
04:03:53,471 --> 04:03:58,847
Dd69 pb66

2325
04:03:59,103 --> 04:04:05,247
67-59 for synchronizing the IMU

2326
04:04:05,503 --> 04:04:11,647
You and the light codes that really makes it a lot better

2327
04:04:13,183 --> 04:04:15,999
Totally had Indiana strong

2328
04:04:27,263 --> 04:04:33,407
I think it's time that you send me something that'll that'll break the

2329
04:04:33,663 --> 04:04:39,807
Well I mean I don't know for sure maybe just doesn't quite look right I guess something

2330
04:04:40,063 --> 04:04:46,207
Little bit closer little bit better

2331
04:04:46,463 --> 04:04:52,607
Looks like the wrong like wrong

2332
04:05:03,615 --> 04:05:09,759
I did want to make sure that it bumps in the

2333
04:05:10,015 --> 04:05:11,807
Right direction when it does

2334
04:05:20,767 --> 04:05:24,607
Bump back

2335
04:05:31,775 --> 04:05:33,567
Oh oh my time

2336
04:05:38,175 --> 04:05:44,319
Make sure this pump function works

2337
04:05:44,575 --> 04:05:45,855
Cats right now

2338
04:06:14,015 --> 04:06:20,159
So the 14-7 whatever is definitely wrong 14 741

2339
04:06:20,671 --> 04:06:22,463
On our way to getting that idea

2340
04:06:29,119 --> 04:06:30,655
Yeah I don't know how it

2341
04:06:31,167 --> 04:06:32,447
Smoking

2342
04:06:32,703 --> 04:06:35,263
Going here can't figure out what

2343
04:07:08,543 --> 04:07:10,335
Oh

2344
04:07:12,639 --> 04:07:14,431
Right

2345
04:07:23,903 --> 04:07:26,975
Ben's most recent comments

2346
04:07:27,743 --> 04:07:33,887
Was Beyonce density experiment might help anyway it's all sensors are multiple eighths make your LED

2347
04:07:34,143 --> 04:07:36,703
What happens

2348
04:07:38,239 --> 04:07:41,823
Did you really compress it that way too.

2349
04:07:48,479 --> 04:07:51,807
580

2350
04:07:58,719 --> 04:08:04,863
I find it hard to believe that this was the most efficient way of

2351
04:08:05,119 --> 04:08:06,143
I'm doing it

2352
04:08:06,399 --> 04:08:12,543
I just this is haha

2353
04:08:18,431 --> 04:08:24,575
Not the way you're thinking ook

2354
04:08:24,831 --> 04:08:30,207
Questions

2355
04:08:31,231 --> 04:08:36,351
Wanted with your last night

2356
04:08:49,663 --> 04:08:50,943
Light number

2357
04:08:51,199 --> 04:08:54,271
I know that is right okay that is correct Spencer ideas right

2358
04:08:54,527 --> 04:08:59,647
Park Place i x

2359
04:09:01,951 --> 04:09:05,023
You're not right

2360
04:09:05,279 --> 04:09:08,607
Okay I'll check that first

2361
04:09:10,399 --> 04:09:16,031
Light number i - x 2 + 1

2362
04:11:21,727 --> 04:11:27,103
Really concerning why is that running off the negative end of the array

2363
04:11:37,343 --> 04:11:41,183
432 10 - 10 K

2364
04:12:13,439 --> 04:12:17,023
337 316 216

2365
04:12:18,047 --> 04:12:24,191
Hey let's try with different constants so right now I'm going to do is when I change the length of time that the LED is on

2366
04:12:24,447 --> 04:12:29,823
So I want to make it 10 10 and 20

2367
04:12:33,407 --> 04:12:34,687
So

2368
04:12:34,943 --> 04:12:38,527
1418 295 that looks about right

2369
04:12:41,599 --> 04:12:44,927
Recommends I suppose

2370
04:12:45,183 --> 04:12:46,463
We will now

2371
04:12:58,751 --> 04:13:01,311
Suppose we can look at everything and Delta's

2372
04:13:53,535 --> 04:13:57,887
And now I'm going to do it then suggest and look at the Delta between the frames

2373
04:14:04,031 --> 04:14:07,615
I'm definitely getting tired you guys can see me making some mistakes

2374
04:14:08,127 --> 04:14:11,455
Correct

2375
04:14:20,671 --> 04:14:23,743
I don't know I can't go for a fact you catch that

2376
04:14:24,255 --> 04:14:28,607
I got a clock reset I want to make sure that when the clock reset it doesn't hose my data

2377
04:14:31,679 --> 04:14:34,495
Well that's not good

2378
04:14:35,519 --> 04:14:37,567
There is a negative number in there

2379
04:14:42,943 --> 04:14:48,575
There's more negative numbers negative numbers bad he can't go back in time what did I do wrong

2380
04:14:51,647 --> 04:14:55,231
Thank you for asking me to check that

2381
04:14:56,255 --> 04:14:58,047
What is the Chapman doing

2382
04:15:13,663 --> 04:15:16,991
I'm not ready to handle simultaneous hit

2383
04:16:06,399 --> 04:16:09,471
Why is my Delta wrong

2384
04:16:10,495 --> 04:16:13,567
I don't want my Delta to be wrong

2385
04:16:21,503 --> 04:16:27,647
Oh I know what you would have done you're going to do something clever with the B when there's more

2386
04:16:27,903 --> 04:16:29,951
Multiple hits at once why

2387
04:16:31,487 --> 04:16:35,839
Whatever I got to get this figured out first why is my Delta is wrong

2388
04:16:43,519 --> 04:16:45,823
Help

2389
04:17:06,303 --> 04:17:09,375
Does anyone else see what I'm doing wrong here

2390
04:18:15,679 --> 04:18:21,567
How many people are in the saying right now

2391
04:18:21,823 --> 04:18:22,335
Okay

2392
04:18:24,895 --> 04:18:27,199
I'm not interpreting my belt is right

2393
04:18:28,223 --> 04:18:33,087
First my time is starting the first hit the end is my time plus First Alpha

2394
04:18:44,863 --> 04:18:48,959
That might be possible

2395
04:18:51,263 --> 04:18:52,543
Right down here

2396
04:18:53,567 --> 04:18:59,199
Ben says that's not quite right you mostly just not interpreting or Tilted

2397
04:18:59,455 --> 04:19:04,063
But I am taking my time by the parameters of this place

2398
04:19:04,319 --> 04:19:10,463
The first my time is the start of the first hit the end is my time plus her first Delta the next one

2399
04:19:10,719 --> 04:19:11,743
My time

2400
04:19:19,167 --> 04:19:25,311
First plus s

2401
04:19:28,383 --> 04:19:31,711
It is accumulating it's right here I have the code on the screen

2402
04:19:35,807 --> 04:19:38,623
420 3548 39

2403
04:19:39,903 --> 04:19:41,951
It's definitely incrementing

2404
04:19:42,975 --> 04:19:44,511
Including

2405
04:19:53,215 --> 04:19:59,359
Ulta

2406
04:20:00,383 --> 04:20:04,223
Exchange nearby

2407
04:20:10,111 --> 04:20:11,647
From the end of the packet

2408
04:20:12,415 --> 04:20:14,207
So don't the one

2409
04:20:15,487 --> 04:20:16,511
Your first

2410
04:20:16,767 --> 04:20:17,791
And

2411
04:20:18,303 --> 04:20:22,911
But Delta to is your your second start not your second end

2412
04:20:25,983 --> 04:20:32,127
I'm interpreting it as the number that the end of the packet is the time of the first hit

2413
04:20:33,151 --> 04:20:35,199
The time of the start of the first hit

2414
04:20:35,455 --> 04:20:39,295
Start of second it is

2415
04:20:43,391 --> 04:20:46,719
They're also know it's that plus

2416
04:20:46,975 --> 04:20:49,279
The Delta time that I read from the parameter

2417
04:20:50,559 --> 04:20:52,095
I think right

2418
04:20:52,351 --> 04:20:56,959
It's not certain which like you think it would be more obvious if you did the experiment

2419
04:21:03,359 --> 04:21:07,967
Okay we will shoot

2420
04:21:08,223 --> 04:21:08,991
Life

2421
04:21:09,247 --> 04:21:11,295
At 2 lights on musically

2422
04:21:11,551 --> 04:21:14,367
True

2423
04:21:17,951 --> 04:21:21,279
Only starts and ends can be interleaved if they overlap

2424
04:22:00,447 --> 04:22:01,471
I don't understand

2425
04:22:01,727 --> 04:22:07,871
Oh my gosh I think if I was more awake just be a lot easier right now but I don't

2426
04:22:08,127 --> 04:22:12,223
I want another 30 minutes

2427
04:22:15,807 --> 04:22:19,135
2:30

2428
04:22:24,767 --> 04:22:28,863
Each sensor

2429
04:22:48,575 --> 04:22:50,367
Don't know what I'm looking at

2430
04:22:53,439 --> 04:22:56,511
Wait a minute what

2431
04:22:57,279 --> 04:22:59,327
Wait a minute

2432
04:23:17,247 --> 04:23:20,063
452 is the new code

2433
04:23:25,695 --> 04:23:30,559
252 is probably like

2434
04:23:37,727 --> 04:23:39,775
Why

2435
04:23:40,031 --> 04:23:46,175
We're going to Vegas

2436
04:23:49,247 --> 04:23:55,391
Frustrated

2437
04:23:56,927 --> 04:24:03,071
This Is the End

2438
04:24:12,543 --> 04:24:15,871
Okay

2439
04:24:20,223 --> 04:24:26,367
Silver frosting from the beginning 52-18 4821

2440
04:24:26,623 --> 04:24:32,767
48 is the actual LED code 5250 to both of them on

2441
04:24:33,023 --> 04:24:39,167
2000 advance

2442
04:24:39,423 --> 04:24:43,519
Four words

2443
04:24:45,567 --> 04:24:51,711
Oki Siri

2444
04:24:51,967 --> 04:24:58,111
You've done something extremely clever

2445
04:24:58,367 --> 04:25:04,511
I'm definitely getting worn down right now

2446
04:25:17,567 --> 04:25:23,711
Matheny's only licensed one light

2447
04:25:23,967 --> 04:25:30,111
Two right two lights

2448
04:25:30,367 --> 04:25:35,231
There we go

2449
04:25:48,287 --> 04:25:50,847
They got that stable

2450
04:25:51,103 --> 04:25:53,151
Alpha trigger both of them

2451
04:25:55,967 --> 04:25:58,783
Come on both we can get this

2452
04:26:00,319 --> 04:26:01,087
Come on

2453
04:26:07,743 --> 04:26:10,303
I can get to other real

2454
04:26:13,119 --> 04:26:14,143
Plus 58

2455
04:26:14,655 --> 04:26:16,191
Not 160

2456
04:26:18,239 --> 04:26:19,519
58/60

2457
04:26:22,079 --> 04:26:23,359
Interesting

2458
04:26:41,279 --> 04:26:41,791
Is it

2459
04:26:47,167 --> 04:26:50,495
I would need to led to test if immediately Heating

2460
04:26:50,751 --> 04:26:54,335
Put the order of the LEDs that I'm reading the minutes is backwards

2461
04:26:54,591 --> 04:26:56,639
Tanto Metro my Deltas are wrong

2462
04:27:03,551 --> 04:27:05,087
If somebody leaves monitoring chat

2463
04:27:07,903 --> 04:27:08,415
Okay

2464
04:27:13,535 --> 04:27:15,071
5860

2465
04:27:19,935 --> 04:27:20,703
I don't

2466
04:27:24,031 --> 04:27:30,175
No cuz I don't have any easy way of making patrl put independently to 2.22 MHz

2467
04:27:30,431 --> 04:27:31,967
LED strend streams

2468
04:27:39,135 --> 04:27:40,159
Oh gosh

2469
04:27:58,591 --> 04:28:00,127
Oh

2470
04:28:00,383 --> 04:28:04,479
That's interesting

2471
04:28:05,503 --> 04:28:07,551
It's significantly lower than when I

2472
04:28:12,927 --> 04:28:16,767
Oh my gosh what is going on there oh

2473
04:28:21,119 --> 04:28:22,655
The Delta OIC

2474
04:28:27,007 --> 04:28:30,079
Is actually the Delta between when they come on and off

2475
04:28:34,943 --> 04:28:41,087
Okay so it looks like I made earlier about being able to do this for the 24 MHz clock I'd have to

2476
04:28:41,343 --> 04:28:42,367
Retract

2477
04:28:42,623 --> 04:28:43,903
That would not be the case

2478
04:28:47,743 --> 04:28:49,535
Say what

2479
04:28:50,559 --> 04:28:51,583
It's not the length

2480
04:28:56,447 --> 04:28:57,215
Saying probably

2481
04:28:59,263 --> 04:29:04,639
Here is not the 1136

2482
04:29:07,967 --> 04:29:10,783
What's the distance between the events

2483
04:29:13,855 --> 04:29:16,415
What's the distance between the two events and time

2484
04:29:56,095 --> 04:29:58,143
Oh okay so it's this time

2485
04:30:00,703 --> 04:30:01,215
Is

2486
04:30:03,263 --> 04:30:04,031
8

2487
04:30:04,543 --> 04:30:07,103
Microseconds later this turns on

2488
04:30:09,151 --> 04:30:13,503
No how would I differentiate between which one it is then and then this event is later

2489
04:30:27,327 --> 04:30:28,607
I was told that I do

2490
04:30:29,631 --> 04:30:30,911
I don't usually though

2491
04:30:33,215 --> 04:30:35,775
Clipart snowflake the dining room.

2492
04:30:38,079 --> 04:30:40,639
I'll try to come to us

2493
04:30:57,535 --> 04:30:58,559
How do you spell

2494
04:30:59,071 --> 04:30:59,839
Yeah

2495
04:31:05,215 --> 04:31:08,799
Next to his name

2496
04:31:10,335 --> 04:31:11,615
If you're not over his

2497
04:31:11,871 --> 04:31:12,383
Chat

2498
04:31:12,639 --> 04:31:13,151
Comet

2499
04:31:18,783 --> 04:31:21,855
I just get it asking me if I wanted to spend time with you

2500
04:31:23,391 --> 04:31:24,671
Let me see if I can find them

2501
04:31:32,863 --> 04:31:33,887
You can fly grandma

2502
04:31:35,167 --> 04:31:36,447
But we can report

2503
04:31:39,263 --> 04:31:43,871
Do you know how about

2504
04:31:52,063 --> 04:31:58,207
Persons

2505
04:31:58,463 --> 04:32:01,535
4 +

2506
04:32:01,791 --> 04:32:06,143
Developer for the Vive is in the chat and has been very helpful with

2507
04:32:06,399 --> 04:32:07,167
A couple

2508
04:32:07,935 --> 04:32:09,471
Like t'bus here and there

2509
04:32:10,751 --> 04:32:15,615
But I'm definitely getting stuck on this Delta's thing something's not quite right

2510
04:32:17,407 --> 04:32:21,759
And it looks like the second flag is the amount of time between

2511
04:32:22,015 --> 04:32:25,855
Something and when the next event happened but I'm not sure

2512
04:32:26,879 --> 04:32:29,439
What that is between the two of them like

2513
04:32:31,743 --> 04:32:36,095
Fight

2514
04:32:36,351 --> 04:32:38,143
Like in that little

2515
04:32:38,911 --> 04:32:39,935
Holier

2516
04:32:42,495 --> 04:32:44,799
The B2 and B8

2517
04:32:45,567 --> 04:32:46,591
Satiate

2518
04:32:49,151 --> 04:32:50,175
P0

2519
04:32:50,431 --> 04:32:51,455
My hit them both

2520
04:32:51,967 --> 04:32:52,991
B2 in VA

2521
04:32:57,855 --> 04:33:00,671
B11 the world

2522
04:33:02,719 --> 04:33:03,487
What

2523
04:33:05,535 --> 04:33:06,815
Is the lowest

2524
04:33:07,071 --> 04:33:08,863
Order

2525
04:33:09,119 --> 04:33:10,399
Oh no

2526
04:33:11,167 --> 04:33:14,239
Determined

2527
04:33:23,711 --> 04:33:29,855
And I have no idea how are you developed able to keep

2528
04:33:30,111 --> 04:33:32,671
Crazy

2529
04:33:37,535 --> 04:33:41,375
The world is that one's dead

2530
04:33:41,631 --> 04:33:47,775
To be a continuation from last reading book?

2531
04:33:48,031 --> 04:33:54,175
4

2532
04:33:54,431 --> 04:33:59,295
Like since the one that lives in tissue with bit set?

2533
04:34:20,287 --> 04:34:26,431
T852 Jason

2534
04:34:26,687 --> 04:34:32,831
Wait wait what 5860

2535
04:34:33,087 --> 04:34:39,231
Enjoying from the Netherlands is asking where we're currently at capturing light with controller to do what

2536
04:34:47,167 --> 04:34:51,263
To make a lighter weight

2537
04:34:51,519 --> 04:34:57,663
I don't even know I'm doing this anymore but honestly it was

2538
04:34:57,919 --> 04:35:04,063
Was because I used Linux I have a Intel integrated graphics card I kind of want to reverse-engineer this myself

2539
04:35:04,319 --> 04:35:10,463
I want to make a really honestly might my big old are is is dependencies as possible so like

2540
04:35:10,719 --> 04:35:16,863
I don't want to mess with osvr I don't want to mess with any of that I'm a c program or just want to have the most basic

2541
04:35:17,119 --> 04:35:21,471
Interface I can be able to tell where I am from the the vibe

2542
04:35:28,639 --> 04:35:31,199
Time

2543
04:35:32,479 --> 04:35:38,623
Hi-5 can you tell me one thing

2544
04:35:38,879 --> 04:35:45,023
Can you tell me if the order in which I'm reading these is correct is 5 a

2545
04:35:45,279 --> 04:35:51,423
Coordinated with this and 60 coordinated with this or do I have them backwards

2546
04:35:51,679 --> 04:35:57,823
Like is it the first second one third one in in left-to-right order or is it reading

2547
04:35:58,079 --> 04:36:04,223
Backwards from the end

2548
04:36:04,479 --> 04:36:10,623
The first parameter and then reading out from there

2549
04:36:27,775 --> 04:36:33,151
I haven't yet updated that 27

2550
04:36:33,407 --> 04:36:38,527
48 million to the second later 60 happened

2551
04:36:38,783 --> 04:36:44,927
Really confuses me cuz 5 a.m.

2552
04:36:45,183 --> 04:36:51,327
60 and that's 5865 why is

2553
04:36:51,583 --> 04:36:57,727
5A what is up with the 619

2554
04:36:57,983 --> 04:37:01,567
What is up with that one's dead

2555
04:37:04,383 --> 04:37:10,527
Forget 5 a.m.

2556
04:37:10,783 --> 04:37:16,927
Interpret the end part correctly it's just a list of times expressed as a star

2557
04:37:17,183 --> 04:37:19,743
Birds and dildos

2558
04:37:23,583 --> 04:37:24,351
Oh

2559
04:37:26,655 --> 04:37:28,191
Thank you

2560
04:37:28,703 --> 04:37:33,567
Thank you Ben

2561
04:37:38,431 --> 04:37:38,943
Okay

2562
04:37:39,455 --> 04:37:41,503
I will

2563
04:37:41,759 --> 04:37:43,295
I will heed your advice

2564
04:37:49,439 --> 04:37:50,463
Where am I

2565
04:37:50,975 --> 04:37:51,999
226

2566
04:37:52,255 --> 04:37:55,839
Really 226

2567
04:37:57,887 --> 04:37:59,679
Realspace

2568
04:37:59,935 --> 04:38:03,263
2:26 a.m.

2569
04:38:03,519 --> 04:38:04,031
Currently

2570
04:38:04,287 --> 04:38:09,663
I'm going to push this back to 2:40 but then we're calling it quits 2:40 p.m.

2571
04:38:10,687 --> 04:38:16,831
Unplug the network connector

2572
04:38:35,007 --> 04:38:37,311
Saudi feeding forward

2573
04:38:37,567 --> 04:38:39,359
Delta's okay set

2574
04:38:44,735 --> 04:38:48,319
Can't we can't really deal with it that way totally

2575
04:38:49,087 --> 04:38:50,623
Not the way to deal with it

2576
04:39:53,087 --> 04:39:59,231
I don't I don't see any use them

2577
04:40:05,887 --> 04:40:12,031
All right but the like try to turn the firmware into anything meaningful

2578
04:40:57,087 --> 04:41:03,231
Quotes

2579
04:41:16,287 --> 04:41:22,431
GIF versus GIF so he's going to post that and chat to go vote

2580
04:41:35,487 --> 04:41:41,631
Jack asked how far you think you would have gotten tonight

2581
04:41:41,887 --> 04:41:48,031
Far enough to the point where I would have realized

2582
04:41:48,287 --> 04:41:54,431
The arguments in lights out of gotten an order of everything correct I think that's where I would have ended I would not have

2583
04:41:54,687 --> 04:42:00,831
Unable to assemble it anywhere close to like the meaningfulness that we're at here

2584
04:42:01,087 --> 04:42:07,231
Space asks if you saw the integer video of a lighthouse recorded without my haircut

2585
04:42:07,487 --> 04:42:13,631
I saw a video from a while ago I also recorded a video of myself

2586
04:42:13,887 --> 04:42:20,031
Which I'm probably not going to put on YouTube anymore since this livestream is here

2587
04:42:20,287 --> 04:42:26,431
Just wondering is anybody at all getting ads or do I have to click the button

2588
04:42:26,687 --> 04:42:32,831
Heart straight through just wondering

2589
04:42:45,887 --> 04:42:52,031
Forsyth no answer what else okay

2590
04:42:52,287 --> 04:42:58,431
Delta equal

2591
04:43:05,087 --> 04:43:11,231
1%

2592
04:43:17,887 --> 04:43:24,031
Okay I'm not going to able to close it tonight I bring

2593
04:43:24,287 --> 04:43:30,431
But I'm going to at least what I think it is

2594
04:43:30,687 --> 04:43:36,831
Check out of tomorrow I think the format is

2595
04:43:43,487 --> 04:43:49,631
Time equals start of event

2596
04:43:49,887 --> 04:43:56,031
Math equals LEDs

2597
04:44:02,687 --> 04:44:08,831
Yeah you're so jealous

2598
04:44:11,391 --> 04:44:12,415
1231

2599
04:44:13,183 --> 04:44:15,743
5

2600
04:44:17,023 --> 04:44:20,095
Yeah I invited you to our conversation

2601
04:44:21,887 --> 04:44:26,239
Places many almost

2602
04:44:31,103 --> 04:44:34,687
Invite chatter I did send invites

2603
04:44:43,903 --> 04:44:46,207
No actually that doesn't make any sense

2604
04:44:47,743 --> 04:44:48,511
Why would that

2605
04:44:49,279 --> 04:44:50,559
NFL

2606
04:44:51,839 --> 04:44:53,887
Instructions

2607
04:45:00,799 --> 04:45:05,151
Disassembler 4851

2608
04:45:34,847 --> 04:45:36,639
Are you

2609
04:45:40,735 --> 04:45:42,271
You know I love you

2610
04:46:10,687 --> 04:46:16,831
It's so funny for hours and hours and hours but then when I do it live

2611
04:46:17,087 --> 04:46:22,463
I need a working harder something that I definitely get dull very quickly

2612
04:46:26,047 --> 04:46:27,583
So

2613
04:46:30,911 --> 04:46:32,191
4 hours before that

2614
04:46:35,263 --> 04:46:37,055
Yeah yeah yeah I got to hear it

2615
04:46:38,847 --> 04:46:41,919
I think that's a cuss word that is a moderator I guess

2616
04:46:44,223 --> 04:46:46,527
River little wrench next to him

2617
04:46:49,855 --> 04:46:50,367
Euro

2618
04:46:50,879 --> 04:46:54,463
So I couldn't make you a moderator just say anything cuz I'm not even the moderator

2619
04:46:55,999 --> 04:46:59,071
Only one person is allowed

2620
04:47:03,935 --> 04:47:05,727
Whatever bugs

2621
04:47:38,239 --> 04:47:41,311
No I need I need to go to sleep

2622
04:48:10,751 --> 04:48:13,311
Where does Audible and resume VR

2623
04:48:15,615 --> 04:48:16,383
Coronavirus

2624
04:48:16,639 --> 04:48:17,663
Where do you get from working

2625
04:48:17,919 --> 04:48:20,479
Frances

2626
04:48:25,599 --> 04:48:27,647
Beautiful body

2627
04:48:36,863 --> 04:48:40,703
17 BR local fire files for it somewhere

2628
04:48:45,055 --> 04:48:48,383
Stop like all of those files that you were looking at

2629
04:48:48,639 --> 04:48:50,431
Free

2630
04:48:50,687 --> 04:48:54,015
Great but they don't have those files to again texiera

2631
04:48:54,271 --> 04:48:57,343
You mean the other wall I mean if they have 543

2632
04:49:05,279 --> 04:49:07,327
Optimum package

2633
04:49:10,399 --> 04:49:13,471
Say

2634
04:49:14,495 --> 04:49:15,519
Whether it is or not

2635
04:49:17,055 --> 04:49:20,383
Are you starting to get worried but I need to download Steam I don't know

2636
04:49:21,663 --> 04:49:27,807
All of my screen packages extinct black so I might not be the right person.

2637
04:49:54,175 --> 04:50:00,319
50th Dakota turns it on 124 Cycles later turns off 1698 Cycles later returns

2638
04:50:05,951 --> 04:50:10,559
Tennis probably face-palming now cuz it took me this long to really actually gather

2639
04:50:10,815 --> 04:50:12,095
Everything together

2640
04:50:17,471 --> 04:50:20,031
Delta p

2641
04:50:29,247 --> 04:50:30,527
Actor

2642
04:50:31,807 --> 04:50:32,831
Okay

2643
04:50:45,119 --> 04:50:49,727
What other Shameless plug if you are still thinking about you know

2644
04:50:50,239 --> 04:50:51,519
Development in the future

2645
04:50:53,311 --> 04:50:55,871
Expressive make some really awesome parts

2646
04:50:56,383 --> 04:50:58,943
Just just looking at in there

2647
04:51:02,783 --> 04:51:03,551
Total

2648
04:51:04,319 --> 04:51:04,831
Think that

2649
04:51:24,031 --> 04:51:28,639
People ask is Jamie going to happen more often and surprisingly fun to watch

2650
04:51:29,151 --> 04:51:33,503
No I mean I don't know it'll happen the reason this happened

2651
04:51:33,759 --> 04:51:39,903
Was I have been trying to get this led to work with this and I just couldn't it wasn't working in somebody

2652
04:51:40,159 --> 04:51:45,023
They commented in one of the things like MHz

2653
04:51:45,279 --> 04:51:51,423
And as soon as I saw that and I tested into work because I knew I would be

2654
04:51:51,679 --> 04:51:52,959
Stream something that was a

2655
04:51:53,215 --> 04:51:59,359
Maybe doable task most of what I do I have no idea if I'm ever going to get anywhere close to being able to do

2656
04:51:59,615 --> 04:52:05,759
I don't bother because this one had a definitive I can start I know which one

2657
04:52:06,015 --> 04:52:12,159
I'm going

2658
04:52:12,415 --> 04:52:13,951
I'm supposed to be here

2659
04:52:16,255 --> 04:52:17,023
5 a.m.

2660
04:52:19,583 --> 04:52:22,143
Super funny YouTube

2661
04:52:22,399 --> 04:52:26,751
We went to what

2662
04:52:27,007 --> 04:52:33,151
So I'm almost there

2663
04:52:35,455 --> 04:52:37,247
Get ready to react to frog

2664
04:52:45,439 --> 04:52:49,023
Express parts are so good they don't need to pay people to advertise

2665
04:53:11,295 --> 04:53:14,111
Another one say he's become the next big Clive

2666
04:53:14,367 --> 04:53:18,463
Afternoon zverev plug mini motorcycles

2667
04:53:19,231 --> 04:53:25,375
But I'm not

2668
04:53:28,191 --> 04:53:34,335
I don't think there's much risk has such as collective

2669
04:53:36,639 --> 04:53:42,783
Oh really because I'm pretty sure everybody who would care to watch this is watching it right now

2670
04:53:43,039 --> 04:53:49,183
Now like I don't think there are more people out there

2671
04:53:55,583 --> 04:53:56,095
Okay

2672
04:53:57,375 --> 04:53:58,399
YouTube

2673
04:53:59,423 --> 04:54:04,031
5A

2674
04:54:04,543 --> 04:54:10,687
Is actually some sort of code is not the visible

2675
04:54:12,991 --> 04:54:18,111
I don't know how that would actually code into thing that the next 10 sec

2676
04:54:18,367 --> 04:54:24,511
The 5808 hold on that's not right that's not right at all

2677
04:54:24,767 --> 04:54:30,911
I - 1 - 2

2678
04:54:31,167 --> 04:54:37,311
If that is greater than or equal to 0 then you can't find it okay

2679
04:54:54,463 --> 04:55:00,607
Revive performance around 12 lights

2680
04:55:07,263 --> 04:55:13,407
Encoded

2681
04:55:13,663 --> 04:55:17,503
Infrared

2682
04:55:17,759 --> 04:55:23,903
It's going to just ignore anything it's not that the codes that is looking for

2683
04:55:24,159 --> 04:55:30,303
I don't know about that because everything I've read about the Nordic

2684
04:55:30,559 --> 04:55:36,703
The problems with the like the other like coexistence with other 2.4 GHz

2685
04:55:36,959 --> 04:55:43,103
Stop but I don't I don't know the details I've only ever used the 10 rs.24 l01 a lot

2686
04:55:43,359 --> 04:55:49,503
And that one was okay so I didn't really I don't really care and

2687
04:55:49,759 --> 04:55:55,903
I would never have guessed that this had a Nordic chip in it because

2688
04:55:56,159 --> 04:56:02,303
Historically

2689
04:56:02,559 --> 04:56:04,095
Leaving performance I get out of the five

2690
04:56:05,119 --> 04:56:11,263
So clearly

2691
04:56:11,519 --> 04:56:17,663
7 microseconds later

2692
04:56:17,919 --> 04:56:24,063
The 60 on at the same time

2693
04:56:24,319 --> 04:56:26,879
Indicates that it would be five and then the sick

2694
04:56:27,135 --> 04:56:33,279
And then 90 seconds later it turns into just 60 so 50 is now

2695
04:56:33,535 --> 04:56:39,679
Off-road four and six on at the same time

2696
04:56:40,959 --> 04:56:47,103
5 first two

2697
04:56:47,359 --> 04:56:53,503
And then 60 for some period of time and then 60

2698
04:56:53,759 --> 04:56:55,295
Returns off to nothing

2699
04:56:55,551 --> 04:57:01,695
So this is 50 then

2700
04:57:01,951 --> 04:57:06,303
60 later

2701
04:57:06,559 --> 04:57:08,351
Then

2702
04:57:08,863 --> 04:57:10,655
90 later

2703
04:57:10,911 --> 04:57:16,799
Exterior only seven

2704
04:57:18,335 --> 04:57:24,479
Now it doesn't make any sense ohyeah 7 later

2705
04:57:24,735 --> 04:57:30,879
60 off 17 not 19

2706
04:57:31,135 --> 04:57:31,647
Later

2707
04:57:31,903 --> 04:57:36,511
50 on

2708
04:57:40,351 --> 04:57:42,399
* 7

2709
04:57:42,911 --> 04:57:45,471
Later 60 on

2710
04:57:53,407 --> 04:57:54,943
Then

2711
04:57:55,199 --> 04:57:57,503
90 later

2712
04:57:58,015 --> 04:58:01,599
6050 off

2713
04:58:03,391 --> 04:58:05,183
Then

2714
04:58:05,439 --> 04:58:11,327
7 L 60 off the understanding of the timecode

2715
04:58:11,583 --> 04:58:15,679
Having some way of figuring out how the multiple codes works

2716
04:58:15,935 --> 04:58:22,079
Do try to understand multiple code

2717
04:58:22,335 --> 04:58:28,479
You do make sure order of on office correct

2718
04:58:28,735 --> 04:58:30,527
To do

2719
04:58:32,319 --> 04:58:38,463
Cat fleas

2720
04:58:38,719 --> 04:58:42,559
Okay

2721
04:58:42,815 --> 04:58:48,959
This is for completely horribleness and sadness

2722
04:58:49,215 --> 04:58:51,263
I'm going to save it and committed

2723
04:59:06,879 --> 04:59:07,903
Okay

2724
04:59:09,951 --> 04:59:10,975
Think I'm done

2725
04:59:13,023 --> 04:59:14,303
