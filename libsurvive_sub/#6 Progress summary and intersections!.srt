1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Everybody thanks for coming out to the 6th htc-vive live survive live stream

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
We're still not calling them five streams B's until we're broadcasting from the headset right here it's

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Not going to be so this one well I don't know

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
First torso there been a lot of prep work be done done before each one of the lifestreams this one

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
Getting to that again because three and four were really rough cuz there was basically no prepped

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Time between the the like previous live stream in the current 12 this time we actually had

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
A little bit time to go back and think with things and get that like

8
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Squared away I guess the first thing we should really cover is some of those things that have been fixed

9
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Since last time so first of all the distant biggie waiter the the

10
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
The process by which these pulses of light are turned into angles

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Was absolutely terrible and It produced some really bad grass

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Really awful distributions of where the angle was and we were trying to average it and

13
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
I mean it is no wonder we weren't able to resolve the position in the lighthouse

14
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Better thankfully I've completely forgotten basically everybody's name who's done this

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you want to go hop in the person who suggested that I was thinking off the wrong tip the wrong

16
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Flash

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Then we can start everything off the wrong flash that it was causing this problem

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Where it would be like kind of wandering and I wouldn't be able to get very good very good

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
So I have up here in the Stream a little picture of how

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Brought it was and is a bunch of them and I think this was the bad one no that was those good

21
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
Maybe oh here it is okay so this picture

22
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
Right here is of just how bad the data was when the data was going well

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Around the center which means that from sweep to Suite to Suite to Suite

24
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
Many times it was producing very very similar results saying he had right here

25
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
But because this was not being done correctly

26
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
You can see the blue thing down here of it just being an awful distribution meeting sometimes as getting a sweep and say

27
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
Over there and was wondering all around and it was just

28
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
Producing terrible terrible data so thankfully I guess Metalhead that figured out pretty

29
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Well and then remember who was it figured it out

30
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
But somebody pointed out that like no that's absolutely wrong you know

31
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
Guess I just ignored them or something and then the data ended up getting a lot

32
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Lot better you can actually see the basically the blue spiked was the only thing there

33
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh okay yeah so this date up here this was for a

34
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
Single Center in this was a single sensor from one Lighthouse and then the other Lighthouse and it turns out that the stinking was

35
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Wrong on one of the lighthouses in right on the other and that's why one of the lighthouses has spectacular data in the other one

36
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Has awful data and then I think here

37
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
You can see I did it for all of the lighthouses all together and even though there's a whole lot of things here that look wide

38
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
It's just the way that the graph is done but you can see it's very very tightly coupled around that center part

39
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
Now there is an interesting effect that's going on though and that's the date has not actually Center

40
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Has this funny sort of like that like not it's not like this

41
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
It's where everything would be like oh we just kind of kilter to one side

42
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm not exactly sure what we should be taking to be the actual point where there should be the peak

43
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Or the average or something

44
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
A pretty big open question I'm not quite sure how to find the the best

45
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
The solution for that another major

46
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Milestone that we were able to hit was that the if I can find that

47
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
Troll app how do I search this

48
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
0x Fe now

49
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
It's not doing it oh wait here it is so one of the other

50
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
Problems with that if you wash them the previous live stream and I'm sure a lot of other people had this whoever was using this

51
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
Randomly the HTC Vive will just stop giving live survive data like you plug it in you turn on

52
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
It was a hundred percent my fault because I was looking at a specific thing and expecting it to be 0xff

53
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
But it wasn't randomly some of the time and tsunamis accepting all the data says like

54
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
Good I got like data okay cool come on through that works just fine now

55
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,999
Don't go away go away search results so

56
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Has clothes that I hide this maybe

57
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:04,799
So I hide there we go so

58
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
Any rate there was another problem yet and I don't think we've totally found it exactly but

59
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
Coming back from the Watchman was producing a funny distribution like this one and that's not

60
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
Not been fully resolved I think famosi resolved on just by what do we do

61
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
Do is I'm here and I'm going to just ignore that I got all that data so weird

62
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
Going to need to find some way of improving the disambiguation her is far as figure out a quail that data just get rid of it

63
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
Invite your rid of it I mean figure out why it's there and integrated into the correct speak

64
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
So the best are one of the other big point

65
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
Is that no longer is the data traveling straight from this with the raw X into any toy

66
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
Tools to find a position to the lighthouses rather there's now an intermediate step there is

67
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
Data processor so to speak

68
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Survive in here

69
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
Under Tools there is a process Rock app and with

70
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
What this does is it takes the the data a CSV file

71
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Attach that whatever let's just use this one so I'm going to go take the data recorder

72
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
New Roc hat. PSV.

73
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Okay so now it's capturing some data for this 5 right here

74
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
Do that

75
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:59,999
I'm not in the picture

76
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
So what this is doing is capturing

77
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
Data for this vibrate here I'm not going to touch it while capturing the data and it's going to be about 2

78
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
Faucet cannot get rid of

79
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Timeouts fine

80
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Yeah you know what now

81
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
This data is coming on in

82
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
And I'm going to stop at now and then I can go use process to Rob points and I can

83
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Go take that data at New Roc half. SSV and it produces

84
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
What it thinks is the estimate of where everything is TimeWise

85
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
And it also produces histograms

86
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
Histograms So based on the state of right here what I have is a bus

87
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
Bunch of different outputs and so what this is Don isn't taking the raw file

88
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
And so at least look at what it's actually doing

89
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
Call this new rock app. SSV so

90
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
Run a tool here and we're on data recorder which is part of life survive

91
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
It produces this right here which is just a listing of all of the lighting effects so the egg

92
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
Al White House with the X sweet and this is the hmd and it's HMDI

93
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
ID number 11 and this was the sweep time that the event happened at and that's the length of the pulse

94
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
Now this is this is great if you want to do something in real-time but it's absolutely terrible if you're trying to do something that needs

95
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
A lot of accuracy over a longer time so this in-between tools the process

96
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Roccat takes that and goes and create stew

97
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Newrock half. CSV

98
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
So in here what this does is it takes all of this data all of these

99
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
Thousands and thousands of lines here

100
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
The weather now 126,000

101
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
126000 sweeps and it condenses it down into this right here

102
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
Which is a much more concise file but this says is on the head-mounted display for

103
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
The lighthouse L with sweep X on sensor zero of the hmd

104
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
It had 1689 hit which Med from that Lighthouse over

105
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
Are they are coming to whichever one is sensor number 0 on here it swept

106
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:18,399
101 689 1689 X and the average

107
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
Which time in sweet this number right here which is actually the angle from the center of the lighthouse being

108
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:31,199
200000 that's the average offset so that's almost straight in front of it

109
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,599
And then in the y-axis so be like right in the middle if it's in the middle of a little bit

110
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
Back that way and then the next one for the for the wife or the El Lighthouse which is over there

111
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Is 174000 that's a little bit back

112
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
Just look at the Lighthouse real quick see if that makes yes that actually does

113
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Backwards cuz the lighthouses mounted sideways but whatever

114
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
And then the same thing the same. Was also visible from the right Lighthouse which is up there

115
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
And 168 X it was able to read that and had that angle off

116
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Which it is a pretty sharp angle to that Lighthouse so that would explain why it was

117
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Who's able to hit the Hawaii sweet but not the ex week for that say rate this is the average

118
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
Angle this is the average length of the pulse which length of the pulse is a function of

119
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
You're coming straight on like so this is the sensor on the HTC Vive thing and this

120
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
If you're going straight on and distance those two things the altar

121
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,399
What the effective pulse length would be and then these last two are the standard of.

122
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
So you can see that right now pretty much all the standard deviations are like in the

123
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
30s or 20s low 30s which is so much better than it was before

124
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,599
I mean it was literally thousands of standard deviation before and it was Tara

125
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Terrible data I'm not sure how it worked I'm just not sure how anything at all got anywhere close to working

126
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
I'm so no longer if you want to go try to find lighthouses yourself no longer do you have to process this map

127
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
ISO file instead all you need to process is this file right here which condenses it down to

128
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
At Mount display which lighthouses sweep the ID of the sensor on the BHM

129
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
Or the watch and the the average time of the

130
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
Which is offset from Center in units of 200,000 and soon I'll be walking through the

131
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Code where I claimed what that means do you like the

132
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
False which currently I don't use but you could probably use and that could probably help resolve position better

133
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
I would imagine cuz apparently valdin a lot of really tricky things to make sure that that day

134
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Data was like Beauty good in does analog magic stuff in the analog domains I don't really

135
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
I want to throw it out and then the standard deviations so you can just read this file and then

136
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
Crossett today to however you'd like so I think that this is already immediately useful to probably some people

137
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
Give me want to do other projects at the HTC Vive so already you can go take data dump it in here

138
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
And then do?? Something with it so from there

139
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
What I can do is I can copy nurock app

140
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
ESPN to find what is it called

141
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
Lighthouse find it's going to Lighthouse fine now and then go make that tool

142
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Lighthouse find New Roc half.to soopsori need to specify lighthouse

143
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
What's called Lighthouse L can't open a good thing

144
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
I'm going to show you guys how to actually get that data in so

145
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
I'm going to do is go over here I'm going to go look at issue number

146
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:34,399
8 which is common data for project and inside of here

147
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
I can go download Charles all can fix and then in here it has all of us

148
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
And everything that you need to operate like my tool and what this does

149
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
It has the same ahmd points and they separated

150
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
In here what it is is it's the location

151
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
Turn on the headset of all of the point the point 0 through 31

152
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
Which one of the sensors on the headset and their XYZ positions so uses this

153
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
In order to help determine the position and steel Bellator includes hmd normals which it also

154
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
Determine position and that is

155
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
Hmd normals is the direction that all of these sensors are pointed in

156
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
I'm so I guess I should actually how I can tell what that is

157
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
If I'm figuring out these things are

158
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Are writing them on the headset itself to file so

159
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Those need to be present in order to operate the the lighthouse feintool right now I'm running

160
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,999
Lighthouse find and it thinks it found the position of the lighthouse

161
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
That's not a very good estimate 2.75 - 1

162
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
.60 access that is about right actually

163
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
The odd part is the White House is kind of cut probably but survival

164
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
John Mayer and the lighthouses in the upper right

165
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
I hear that looks like that's about right

166
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
What is Lighthouse was kind of talked to the side they're so

167
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Measure the distance from the L Lighthouse alive

168
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
What is 410

169
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,999
410 cm

170
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
Let's see if that works out

171
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
Hey don't complain about me screaming at this time of day I started all the others at 9

172
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
I need your improvement peso to 71 cm

173
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
* 271 + 166 * 166

174
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,399
7 + 281 281

175
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Squirt 424

176
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
I was trying to fake that a little bit look like she measured it really is

177
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Oh my God

178
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Look at that right there

179
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
420 something mm 220cm 420 something cm

180
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
That is absolutely ridiculous to that one worked

181
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
Great let's check the other lighthouse

182
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:03,199
You want to run that together lighthouse

183
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:09,599
So it says

184
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
Anime b274

185
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
7050 what the system thinks

186
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
Lighthouses so now we're going to use Lighthouse to find to find the our lighthouse

187
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
The going to go do it the thing and

188
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
What is this workout too so I'm using the position of the lighthouse that's

189
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
48 * 48 + 203 * 2/3 + 88 * 88

190
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,399
Court of the whole thing 226

191
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,799
270

192
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:07,199
Ironic

193
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
Remember what I just said for that distance cuz I don't remember or we can use my card again

194
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
227

195
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
Well I got bad news it's should be

196
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
Reality

197
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:39,200
We're going to have to go figure out what's going on there

198
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
Is the other one was pretty good getting data again just in case that

199
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:52,000
Are actually better yet

200
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,400
Try running that data again

201
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
More visible and one thing we can also do is

202
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
Look at the the are lighthouses different scenery many entries

203
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600
We do it should be enough to get it going

204
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
Not really sure why it's not working well

205
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
Let's do it again so you got kind of see how this work for if you want to capture some date

206
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
Live survive data recorder run

207
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
PSE

208
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
Run To Die. The big sorry do do

209
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
Now

210
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
Got to turn it on turn it on

211
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
Just going to record some data now

212
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:21,600
Just recording some data

213
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
Private there

214
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
I think that's probably enough data

215
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
No I don't just take my back cuz I don't really have

216
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,600
Any reason to I'm pretty flexible

217
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
Cool lightning process Rock

218
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
Process 2.12

219
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
Dumping in Whitehouse find run to.psp go

220
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:19,200
Run to top his Fields make sure it looks good though yeah that looks pretty good

221
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
Alex real bad okay

222
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:32,000
Find are against Ron to dupps ESV

223
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,400
That looks about right

224
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
So RL

225
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
Cuz

226
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,944
From the lighthouses are from the things point of view

227
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
About that

228
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,256
So

229
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
I guess we'll measure that

230
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
Think I can get it

231
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
Thank you Dave

232
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Around 303 p.m.

233
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:40,864
Be here what are we get

234
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
296 NM

235
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
It's okay

236
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Not

237
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Great

238
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Dial

239
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
I almost as much as a decimeter

240
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
The algorithm is similar to the old algorithm it's a little bit different now though

241
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:19,520
I don't really know how to convey what those differences are bull step through the way the code

242
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Work shortly

243
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
Tom

244
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
At any rate

245
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,760
So I've now showing you how to capture data how to process the data and how to

246
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,832
Using mightily by the way is different than

247
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:38,720
Is there a two other people that have competing tools which I'm kind of hoping you guys can kind of take over for that

248
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,840
Make your tools really good and

249
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
And then

250
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,520
Let me have the positions of the lighthouse now this can be confused

251
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
Fahey's 10 cm

252
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,992
No I think I use my units right

253
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,416
What are you what are you just talking about there

254
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah I probably would be better so you're saying I calculated this part wrong and if so can you

255
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,336
Just checked my nap on it

256
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,400
297 still off by a little bit it's not not great it's closer but

257
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
I measured the distance from the base so that could add about do that actually would that

258
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,968
Without about well I got maybe about two or three centimeters

259
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,808
Hi whatever it's close enough point is we're getting there

260
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
So we're getting pretty good resolution on that

261
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
It's one by one

262
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,008
I don't understand this is a m

263
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
169 cm to 43 cm

264
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,064
100 that's 1 mm 1 cm

265
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,464
Close enough

266
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
Calculate that out 1 * 1 + 16 170 * 170

267
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
244 x 244 squirt tonight

268
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,848
Can't even tell the difference

269
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,272
Okay I will tell you guys what the deal is with the Orton now

270
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
I'm not measuring from the actual origin of the lighthouses

271
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
That's that's a decent point I was not measuring from the front I was measuring from the

272
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:32,032
So you look at that Lighthouse up there

273
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:38,176
I was measuring from back over here not from like inside the

274
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
The main body of the lighthouse so I know that's not I didn't move

275
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Yeah well

276
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
What do you mean by forward equipment system but forward isn't meaningless

277
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
There's right front end

278
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
I mean for worldspace let's define b o z is physically outfit

279
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,976
Yes okay and actually physically right is here

280
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
I would say

281
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
So

282
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
Here is my

283
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
5ive

284
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
And Z is coming out the front of the Vive which is the direction of googly eyes

285
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
Derby

286
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Anyway

287
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
The disease coming straight out exercise decide and wise up

288
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
Up and down on my camera which ones are plus right now I think A+ why is that way

289
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,376
And then plus tax it whatever it makes the right-handed coordinate system

290
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
Thing work

291
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Right self

292
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
There's that

293
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,896
Yeah I really should probably calculate euclidean distance but it'll be fine

294
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,928
Okay so what I'm doing to calculate the euclidean distance all that is

295
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
It's basically just like the Pythagorean theorem button three dimensions so if you try to fight you have like a try

296
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Mangle

297
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:43,360
I can't make that with two hand okay I'll go get a whiteboard

298
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,464
So if you have a

299
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
That oriented good for you guys to get looks like it this and I have the light

300
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Health dare in the vibe here

301
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Over here

302
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,272
I want to find this Justin Frank here

303
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,320
And the way you do that

304
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,488
I'm writing upside down so I don't even know if this

305
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
It's all backwards

306
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,728
You have the X in the Y

307
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
And I want to know

308
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
What is this

309
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,432
And this is the square root of x squared plus

310
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
Y squared plus the squares

311
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,304
Taking the square root of x squared plus y squared

312
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
Plus Z squared

313
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,240
And it wasn't that simple

314
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576
Yeah I know seriously this is actually a piece of shower board you can buy 4 ft by 8 ft pieces of

315
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,952
Shower board from Home Depot for $9 I think

316
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,096
And you can buy dry erase markers from the dry erase erasers

317
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
From the

318
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
The clothing store

319
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
Okay so there is just now I guess I should

320
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,832
Finish talking about the the aspect of this that we improved so I took the data

321
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
Prom after fixing all of these input and rent through the 3D visualization tool again

322
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
And it resolved perfectly

323
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
Perfectly but

324
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
Really really well but I was just a really good good thing

325
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,336
The inaccuracy here is

326
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Is in this actor

327
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:15,072
It is the the this accident so I guess now is probably the best time to explain to you

328
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,936
Oh no Octavia saying something

329
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
Okay I definitely time to explain the orientation of everything based on the ancient gear

330
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
That better

331
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Okay

332
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,144
Do all of the numbers that I'm dealing with right now to see what I will do I'll make that bigger

333
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
Are pretending that this Vibe here is the origin

334
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,088
I am defining it as the origin

335
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,672
There's nothing else no nothing it is

336
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Right now if that's the Vive

337
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,376
Then what I have is I've defined a universe who is Center is actually

338
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:28,032
Right here in the Bible that's where the hmd points is centered in and

339
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:33,408
It's the coordinate frame like the direction for X Y and Z is all defined

340
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
By-the-bye distill

341
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,600
So now all the sudden if I give you coordinates like these Lighthouse coordinates

342
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
Point gyro 1, 1.6 99, 2.4 39

343
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,584
What I'm giving you is I'm giving you these coordinates

344
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,400
In absolute terms

345
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
From the hmd itself

346
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,544
Until what I would say is if it stays a d turn here

347
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
His 2.4 39-43

348
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
9 up

349
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
Because that's D coming out of the center and then for the next term

350
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
0.010 so it's just a little bit

351
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
But this way

352
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
From your point of view that way I guess

353
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
So I fixed it though it

354
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
That's your point of view

355
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,896
Your guy's point of view would be up

356
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
And then this way

357
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
This way about a centimeter

358
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,552
So very very off a little bit

359
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
And then 1.69 go back a long ways so I'm actually

360
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
What does verify that let's find out

361
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,840
What the what the actual

362
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
Way in which the report says I'm so I can get some directions on the

363
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,104
On these units here so I'm going to put the vibe right here

364
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,736
And I'm going to orient it such that the L Lighthouse over there

365
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,784
Will be in what I think

366
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,112
Is + y + x

367
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
Clumsy

368
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
It's something I just put this on the floor here

369
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,096
And I'm going to go run some data and we'll see if that resolves to what I think it will

370
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
Crab pretzel

371
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
Capturing data

372
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
Telegram

373
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,704
The vibe is right there and it's oriented such that the L Lighthouse up there is what I believe to be

374
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,800
Positive X+ y positive and I can be wrong but we'll find out

375
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
It currently running

376
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
That's probably enough data

377
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
I'm going to go process the data

378
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,848
And I'm going to go find the L lighthouse on Run 3 and it

379
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:49,248
He claims that it is positive X+ y positive

380
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
Info this is unusual it may be confusing because if I move them around

381
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,208
World babe off the moves around

382
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
But

383
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,560
As it stands with the vice sitting right here

384
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:08,192
That Lighthouse over there is positive 2.59 X which looks about right

385
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,288
Positive positive 1.95

386
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,640
Why which is that correction which is about right

387
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,200
2.188

388
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:24,320
Whatever up that amount Pinto Define supposition

389
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Of

390
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
Oh okay so the vibe here

391
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,072
Define the position of the

392
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Above it all up

393
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
Left all that jazz

394
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:44,800
So hopefully that makes some semblance of sense

395
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
Andy was right on the Vive right now actually no we can do let's double-check some of these things

396
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Survive

397
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
Directly at Lighthouse L over there

398
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
So good as I can get the view

399
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
So I can first

400
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Now I forgot the orientation

401
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
Thanks that was it

402
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Boss running again

403
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,080
Braun for

404
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
Collecting data

405
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,264
Just wondering is D is the volume for everything good for you guys

406
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
Doctor up a little bit

407
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
I can see that

408
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,183
I am from from the USA we are outside Baltimore

409
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,935
Dad's probably got enough data is processed 14

410
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Okay

411
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
14

412
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Got that

413
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,967
Naproxen Pharrell light out I think this should be

414
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
Play Spotify

415
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:36,159
Good so from this htc-vive point of view

416
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,495
This is what it is

417
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,103
So somebody wants to take a screencap of this right now and post it to

418
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
To the

419
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,759
Can take a screencap of this

420
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:07,647
And post it to the HTC Vive commentator for project

421
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:14,047
That would be super cool cuz then we would know always what the coordinate frames for the HTC Vive

422
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
5r that would be like super helpful so don't everybody rush at 1

423
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,847
And so he says anything the next ten seconds I'm going to go with science to Josh Allen there

424
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
What's Josh you wanted to take it

425
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
So you guys posted to HTC vivacious

426
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
SKU number 8

427
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
They just posted in this thread here

428
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,775
Nope looks like Mr was and did Notch. It

429
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,991
You guys can all posted we can select the best one and go from there

430
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:13,695
That's a really good idea at least for the sake of of this right here

431
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
So I'm going to do is put the HTC Vive on

432
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
Honest here

433
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
And I'm going to

434
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
To see that okay

435
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
Is that good

436
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
Does that make sense

437
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,551
Going to go light up the Evite a little bit more somebody wants to take a screenshot of the

438
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
That at work for you guys

439
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Hi

440
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Whatever

441
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,783
Got it. If you wife want you can take a screenshot of this text you mind getting that

442
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:55,327
D-do you want to talk about what you're doing soon or

443
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
Well

444
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:02,751
I clearly had tons of more stuff.

445
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:07,871
For plotting the the results a little better

446
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:14,527
So I can show you what I've got so far I can connect in give me just a second okay I'll wait

447
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
Just make sure that I get the right grid size and maybe Inc

448
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:27,327
Point of the line with 441 of the things that I'm flying

449
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:32,959
We can wait on that one window

450
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
Okay then do you mind if I bring a screen

451
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
Bring up your screen out

452
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,175
I'm going to make you a little bit smaller

453
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
320 x 240

454
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
Go home

455
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:52,671
So here we wait on Spotify yet kind of out but let me

456
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,071
Greatest little jarring here maybe I should reduce the

457
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,607
Point size for the grid

458
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,335
You know you're you're alive when you can't

459
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
When typing

460
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
I have a huge delay

461
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,015
Oh does it actually a delay

462
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,111
Okay you are definitely live now though

463
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Rotten

464
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
There we go

465
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
So here the Centerpoint here supposedly the head-mounted display

466
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,119
Each voxel here is 3 m

467
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,983
A large can you guys can you hear what I'm saying

468
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,943
Do I need to get closer to a microphone give me a second time I know what I'm going to do is make this

469
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,575
On always visible workspace

470
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,415
Are they say yes so you can hear me

471
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:00,511
Alright so each box will hear is 3 m

472
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,351
And I'm just taking the result from the

473
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:11,007
My Lighthouse find program and the I believe them

474
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:17,407
Blue is the left right now which one's the left and which one's the right I forgot already

475
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,807
Is red okay

476
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:30,207
Left lighthouse in the blue point is the right Lighthouse and the Green is right in the origin

477
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:36,607
And I am supposedly plotting both the position and the orientation of a lighthouse

478
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:41,727
But I want to make sure the orientation is right so

479
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:47,103
That's what I'm working on right now and I guess

480
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,271
Yeah I'm just working on that that first I want to get to the common filters

481
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,879
Stop pretty soon but the next thing I'm going to do is

482
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:05,279
Is add some lines to the head-mounted display.

483
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Actors

484
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,703
Add the bearing angles to this visualization to make sure that the bear

485
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:19,103
Angles for both the left and the right makes sense so that's that's the next thing to try to do

486
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,455
So I'll be working on that next half hour or so

487
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:30,879
So I guess we should pop back to my code now

488
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Red

489
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,607
Right to read eat to remember

490
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,991
Hard slaps a plan together small demon that reads all the 5-day to make successful Networks

491
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
With you

492
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
Both can read it live

493
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,743
I wouldn't do that hard actually it's an interesting idea

494
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:14,143
The website is in the description it says to github.com

495
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:20,543
Seattle or slash live survive

496
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
Protecting interesting idea maybe we could do something so

497
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
We have the lighthouse data pretty good we could potentially even expose the

498
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,743
Over the Internet so that when I run the program

499
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:46,143
I mean I can just actually get this and read the data from it

500
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:52,543
Suppose that over a pork everybody on the internet if somebody wants to try to play with like netcat

501
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
And it'll just give you the data single-stream

502
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,343
Broadcast it out to everybody okay Josh

503
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,743
I'll take a look at that we make a note to do that though cuz I want to do a few other things first, specially since then

504
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:18,143
Just got here if you're still here stick around for about one minute I want to I want to do something

505
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
Who does that look like does that look

506
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,743
Like who I think it looks like I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking that really looks like who I think

507
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
It looks like

508
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:56,543
Did you are

509
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:02,943
Stevia the same thing

510
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:09,343
Exactly like a Ono okay I'll pull up the two pictures

511
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,743
Don't even know where to find a good picture of

512
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:34,943
No not really

513
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
Looks like the Quaker Oats guy anyway moving on

514
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,743
Yes I meant Alan anyway

515
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:54,143
The way in which I process today

516
00:52:54,399 --> 00:53:00,543
And then I'll publish it to the internet the data going real time

517
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:06,943
Wait that's not photoshopped I'll man you guys are going to

518
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,743
Apparently not Photoshop according to ban I don't know if I believe him

519
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:26,143
I don't know if I believe him

520
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:32,543
Anyway moving on

521
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:38,943
Other people that have been working on the problem at the same time so there's probably

522
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,343
Probably a little bit more other people have different opinions on how this would work

523
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,743
But the first part is when I process the wrong thing

524
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:58,143
My process to the point that this file right here this is in the tools folder and it part of

525
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:04,543
The the

526
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,943
Kim Blain bragging Blain brain blanket anyway

527
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
Tools process Rock app. Process Rock-a-Bye a process to Poinsett see and those I said earlier that

528
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
What takes in the Stream of data and average is it in.

529
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:30,143
All of the other stuff and throws it out there's a couple of things that I'm actually doing with the data and I think it makes sense

530
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
Explain that first so the first one is the

531
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
The maxlend time if anywhere larger than that it just gets dropped

532
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:49,343
I use that to determine the the Peaks and histograms for where and which the data lies

533
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,743
So I go over all the day to begin with and I produce a histogram by putting the ding how

534
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:02,143
And I find the highest being count and so

535
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:08,543
What that mean if I have the data right here

536
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,943
And I'm processing it that did not open right

537
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,927
I have a date and I'm processing it

538
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,839
What it does is for each of these Benz

539
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
Don't know what's up with that

540
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,543
Well you're here just so that you you see this in case it rings up any bells for you

541
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,943
I did a histogram of the Watchman data and if I don't get rid of the second poop right here

542
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:53,343
For whatever reason the Watchman I got a really nicely shaped thing like where I think the the app

543
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
Actual Watchman is but then I get this weird sort of free Echo that just a

544
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
Couple Tik thinking groupings of four texts but just mean it's a very small length of time and get a whole bunch

545
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:10,239
I thought that was weird

546
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,055
Senator what we could be doing wrong anyway

547
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
What I do is

548
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:22,783
In this code here I develop a histogram and it's to find where the best centroid is

549
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
And so for data like this when it develops that histogram what it'll do is it'll keep updating

550
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
Each one of these cells until it finds like okay this is the bend that has the most data

551
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,983
With the highest number of points so chances are the the data that centered around this are

552
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,615
Area right here is the right data so I throw out any like outliers

553
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,455
Mom and that makes so we don't have to worry about them and they don't throw off our average

554
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:58,111
So that's that part of the data right there and then after I threw out all the outliers I then

555
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
I actually go sweep over all the thing and I find the app

556
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,911
Average bombs that means now over this little area right here which is a really weird

557
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:17,311
Confucian I don't know what's up with that go take a look at a different one so I don't get all anxious

558
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:23,711
Apple butter

559
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:30,111
With this distribution right here what I do is I find the average in here

560
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:36,511
I'm not the average of all the points that might not be the best way to do it but since we're splitting these tools out the different tools it's a lot

561
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
Easier to kind of

562
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,887
Tweak the algorithm some at any rate

563
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
We have a we have that it finds the averages and then I go back over it and I deter

564
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,943
Carmen is standard deviation for both of them and so if we take a look at the

565
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,271
The actual output here

566
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
Do under Lighthouse find

567
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:06,975
For what I have outputted is hmd the camera the sensor

568
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,279
How many points are actually read

569
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,679
And the average of the time in the sweep the average pulse time and the standard deviation

570
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:22,079
And so that's how we get this data from the huge list of streaming date

571
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
Once we have that we can then use Lighthouse find d'usse

572
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,879
So Dave and I were actually going over this earlier today so I think I'm going to add some

573
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
More comments as I go

574
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:42,559
Pause the stage one again

575
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,911
Oh there's a lot of things or not or something

576
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
Yeah I'm I'm confident I don't have any Reflections well okay there might be one thing I'll get fixed before I do a data stream

577
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
Okay

578
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:16,095
Okay so going over the lighthouse find algorithm

579
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:22,495
Stage one here is where we find the the vector position of the lighthouse that

580
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,895
Target in that means that I try every possible position of where the lighthouse could be in 3D

581
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:34,271
And I kind of sweet this huge area and

582
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:40,671
Check actually a 45 M 5 m in One Direction 5m in the other 555

583
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:47,071
Only there's I don't check below zero it's not going to worry about that because for me I'm going to do

584
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,935
Define that whenever you calibrate the system you must have the hmd pointing straight up

585
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,663
And then I cycle a 30 times I do this whole sweep area now sometimes a little bit more accurate than

586
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,807
Whole area 30 *

587
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,647
But you know we'll keep going over and over and over it

588
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:18,303
Now what we do is we split the space into this many

589
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Groups

590
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Tend

591
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:30,591
Jeff were on the first cycle we want to do a very linear

592
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:36,223
And what that means is we're going to check through 32

593
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,111
Buy 32 actually 32 * 264 by 64

594
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:49,791
32 up and down points into the ideas we don't want to get stuck in a local maximum

595
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,631
We want to try to make sure that we avoid that we want to get the best kind of

596
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,191
Canvas of the area that we had

597
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:04,383
So if it's very linear as we refine our search

598
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,455
We can then use a more

599
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,271
Binary search technique

600
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,183
Tom and there's a really cool thing I never even thought about that as a possibility for much of anything

601
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:24,351
But then video games there's the technique called relief mapping and relief mapping allows you to

602
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:30,751
Basically nothing but you can pretend that there's a fly

603
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:34,591
Flat surface here that will actually have like shapes inside of it

604
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
And

605
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
Oh my

606
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:42,783
He'll like it shapes inside of it and you can kind of tear through the surface

607
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
And as the surface rotates so to the point inside now Parallax mapping that is a really basic way

608
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:55,583
Way to do it is really Advanced because it's actually retracing inside of the surface this is actually

609
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:01,983
Used video games and the ray tracing that's used so from the eye

610
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,383
High-end surface they first do a linear search checking a whole bunch of points and then in order to find

611
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,247
Define at the use of binary search later so I use a very similar technique here

612
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,831
And so now

613
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,391
We searched

614
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
Through the

615
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
Whole face

616
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,167
And

617
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,335
Staples confused originally these are adjustment

618
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
2 best

619
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
2

620
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
The

621
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,415
Fast from last frame

622
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:04,447
Hey ray-tracing you might think it's expensive than cycle time but it's ray-tracing is just trivial and like I'm free

623
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
Things like the Vive like I tell you one of the first things I'm going to do once I get this working is it going to go Port some version

624
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
No Euclid to it because Ray tracing is so much easier cuz you don't have to supersample or any of the

625
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,183
You have to do with traditional Rider anyway

626
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,935
So what we do is cycle over each one and then forgiven position that we're trying in space

627
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,055
We go run this function run Opti so let's take a look at runoff d right now

628
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:47,711
Run off to just says pretending have a camera right here where would it have to be pointed to be pointed at the place that

629
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:54,111
Pointed in real life so that the data we're getting from the lighthouse would lineup

630
01:03:54,367 --> 01:04:00,511
Does the first check to see if it's a valid Viewpoint and this is where the normals come in really important

631
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:06,143
So the idea is an active I should really do is document that

632
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:11,519
TSA sensor is pointed away from where the lighthouse

633
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,311
Where

634
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,687
We are testing a possible Lighthouse position

635
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,807
Get data from that lighthouse

636
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:28,415
Then we know this is not a possible

637
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,535
White House position

638
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,095
Okay so what that means is

639
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
Say say where I'm going to say like maybe the lighthouses where my head is right now and maybe

640
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
I'm looking at the vibe right there

641
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,431
But in our data set it says that I was able to see a sensor over there

642
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,735
Like all the way on that side of it

643
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Let me instantly know that

644
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:59,391
I can't possibly be with A Lighthouses because I wouldn't be able to see that

645
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,743
So all we have to do is just take the dot product of the normal

646
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:07,839
And the vector between the center of the HTC Vive in my face

647
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,679
And if they if a DOT product is -1

648
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:18,079
Can't be possible so we can immediately throw that out we don't have to do any more complicated algorithm

649
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,663
Whatever we just know that it's not a valid location

650
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,063
Once we do that

651
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,111
We can iterate

652
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:36,255
Over a refinement of the angles

653
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
That constitute

654
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,095
Irv the

655
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,167
That constitutes

656
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
Lighthouse

657
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Okay

658
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,943
And so at this here means is I'm going to cycle six times and I'm going to try to find the position of

659
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
The lighthouse

660
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:02,367
And that down a little bit

661
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:06,207
A little bit anxious about it cuz it's kind of hard to explain

662
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
Must be here let me see if I can stop that it's hard to explain that it's hard for

663
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:19,007
Remember how I did it cuz I'm not that great at math

664
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:25,407
But see here so if it's a valid hit

665
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:31,807
We have an angle from the lighthouse pointed outward and so AXA why is in Radium

666
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:38,207
From the center of the lighthouse so we have

667
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:57,407
So if I have a lighthouse

668
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:03,807
Right here

669
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,095
Oh wow that's really clear now

670
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,495
We have a lighthouse right there and it's viewing

671
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,775
Bring out this way

672
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:29,663
And we're looking at save the rotor for the Y so it's that one right there

673
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
We're talking about

674
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:37,855
It's this angle right here and then what this does

675
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:44,255
That's measured in radians and so what we

676
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,071
We actually have is

677
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
Seda

678
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
And that can be done for both the X and the Y but let's just assume roll

679
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:59,615
We're looking at the X right now of the fleet

680
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,175
So that's how that part works

681
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,039
Never be correct the cross product

682
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,999
Oh okay

683
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:34,175
Okay so it looks like what I do is I create a vector

684
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,527
Find

685
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
How does this work

686
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:49,279
So it doesn't do any reading out a vector and three face that is that represent from Imagine

687
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,679
Lighthouse 2000 pointed straight up it's creating a tuple in Normal

688
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:02,079
Is Vector in 3D space that would represent a real that shooting out from it so imagine that the light

689
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,871
Houses pointed straight up

690
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,455
So positive Z is that direction

691
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:13,599
And now we have an X and A Y is back into the board components to that

692
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:19,999
So then we can rotate the re-buy that current estimation

693
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,351
And it isn't the current Lighthouse quaternion estimation

694
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,911
I'm actually calculated elsewhere

695
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,495
Initialize to nothing

696
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,519
Whatever

697
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
Is it

698
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:36,127
The point is that it takes that

699
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
And

700
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:48,671
Now it's really confusing what that means is it takes to be the lighthouse

701
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:55,071
Find the point in actual space that would represent this Ray and then rotate the lighthouse down or

702
01:09:55,327 --> 01:10:01,215
I could be down towards it and then once it's rotated down towards it

703
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,615
Looks like that's the first one is where it rotates it down

704
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,919
Lighthouse playing up

705
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:16,319
Down at it but it doesn't know this orientation Sonos it needs to be swept here but once a tear it needs

706
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:22,719
To resolve this a little bit better could be a bug

707
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,999
Text that

708
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:31,935
Rotate the left and right and then it fight tries to find the best possible

709
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,751
Rotation for the lighthouse from that point of view

710
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:41,663
And then it goes and refined that little bit more every time for all 32 times until the changes its

711
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,503
And so that happened

712
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,575
One for every possible place we want to try

713
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:54,207
And like a factory just keeps cutting in closer and closer so

714
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,023
That's going there

715
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,143
Looks like everything still going well

716
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:08,287
The next thing that we should probably talk about is

717
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,895
Really run task cuz I just print out the results loading the data

718
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:19,295
So this is a little bit earlier so that he would be able to load the data

719
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,855
It's coming from the process to point file

720
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
And invalidating stuff

721
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,207
So what it does

722
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,583
Is it open chmp points which is the positions of all of the points on here

723
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,911
And I think that you guys little bit earlier

724
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:40,543
But it's just the XYZ location it reads them into H-E-B points buffer

725
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:44,639
It opens up the normal the normal 10th indeed Point buffer

726
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:06,143
Remember that normals are used to throw out unused data

727
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:11,775
And then poop dooba dooba dooba dooba dooba dooba dooba dooba

728
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
Down here

729
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:20,223
Actually load the the process

730
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
Data

731
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
Okay

732
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:32,767
Do the format is hmd meaning head mounted display

733
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,607
Elek meaning camera l

734
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,191
Number of point in that 1000 times

735
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
And what does it loads that into the buffer but then in order to calculate the angle that little Theta that I told you guys

736
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:52,991
About the theater right there what it does is it take the the average time

737
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:59,391
Which is that number that I gave you mine is 200000 divided by 200,000

738
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,927
Times of Full Circle

739
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,255
And so that's how get that angle in radians

740
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,303
And that's what it confused everything with

741
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,399
So this is the full explanation for

742
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
Howell I am currently doing the algorithm to find the physician

743
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,943
Please talk briefly about some of the other people's solutions for this sort of thing

744
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,271
Hello what is going on

745
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,391
How people are chatting in their Fair bit

746
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,815
Do some other people had a ideas about how to do it and most them involve

747
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:46,495
They're here somewhere

748
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,343
I don't even know what that is why I angle vs Pistons

749
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,455
I don't know where to find it

750
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:33,855
There's another way that people have been trying to solve this and the other way the people been trying to solve it

751
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:40,255
Buy this kind of triangle theorem and the idea would be that from this

752
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,583
Point right here if you have to point here and here

753
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,655
Erasing stuff first

754
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,127
If I'm if I'm up here

755
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
And I'm viewing like that

756
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,527
And there's two points here and here

757
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,135
I would be able to exit 83

758
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:11,487
I would be able to use the distance between the two point

759
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,279
And these two point

760
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,607
In order to determine the possible locations of death

761
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,703
Which works in two dimensions and you can extrapolated for three dimension

762
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,567
Hi Mike you said hey there's something wrong

763
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:30,431
I'll keep talking while you tell me if something's wrong

764
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:37,087
By using these distances you can then resolve the position of

765
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,879
Where the lighthouse could be

766
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:45,279
And I think their Solutions work really well too and there were simpler than mine so maybe the right

767
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:50,399
Combination or

768
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,471
I don't currently have any pull request

769
01:15:53,983 --> 01:16:00,127
From from anybody you know offering this is a pothole solution so if you really need to

770
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,663
I can

771
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:08,063
As you guys wanted earlier it sounds like a pretty good time for me

772
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,927
To make a data server for you guys

773
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:17,791
Something that will allow you to stream the data

774
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
To yourselves

775
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:28,031
Let's go all the way to the Bottom now

776
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
So

777
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
What I'm going to do

778
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,503
I don't know what's going on

779
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:10,015
By the way this is totally how you legitimately do engineering like

780
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,855
Depressing I know

781
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,535
No don't do that that looks hard to copy

782
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,119
At 1

783
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,167
Click click click

784
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
You look like a good candidate for me to rip off

785
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:40,223
Sure why not that was close enough

786
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,295
Poop copy paste

787
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:33,727
Play 1000 Maverick can be included twice nobody cares it's fine

788
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,879
Remind you that

789
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
I'll have a list

790
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,608
I think they're doing a lot of stuff here that's not really needed but I don't really care

791
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:34,112
Yeah I think there are some people who don't have the

792
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:40,512
Quaker Oats

793
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:53,312
I ate it the resemblance

794
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:59,712
Just there I I just can't not see it once I saw it

795
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:31,712
I don't really care who you are

796
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:29,312
Chris I used Linux Mint

797
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:35,712
So that I can keep my beloved mate which is also known

798
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:42,112
Home two or three or whatever it is cuz I am really bad at changing like gooey

799
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
So Linux Mint is like Ubuntu except with the old the old GUI

800
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:26,912
I can listen any you guys you can send me whatever you want

801
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
Ignore it looks like that'll work

802
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:39,712
Send thread hero

803
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:11,712
Remember what standard in his is just one ft is 1

804
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:18,112
Right

805
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
Don't wait

806
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,912
No piping don't wait to Socastee

807
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:34,912
Don't know you guys are talking

808
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:47,712
That's really sad

809
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:54,112
I didn't know that about him that really were sowing your Wild Oats comes from

810
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:10,912
Yeah I kind of want to just watch you guys as you can act in I think of you a lot

811
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:17,312
So I'm going to do that

812
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,760
Thank you

813
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,320
Thank you

814
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,368
Mr. Yates

815
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,976
Chief virologist

816
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,048
Let's use that

817
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,656
Now let's find out how many years I have

818
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,408
Dash I.

819
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,736
Shred

820

821
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:16,864
Eita and thread

822
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,936
I capitalized

823
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:26,336
Try that okay

824
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
Stop

825
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:40,160
Find

826
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:46,560
Why is that not working

827
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:59,360
Should be right there what's wrong with that

828
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:09,856
You know what I don't even care

829
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:19,840
No weird

830
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:52,352
Well I didn't work

831
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:05,152
Anybody seen my problem doing something.

832
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:13,088
Poopoo poopoo poopoo poopoo

833
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:19,488
Thredup

834
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,192
Stop

835
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,264
Oops

836
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:44,576
Call so I should probably actually disconnect people and they get dropped

837
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,768
Oops

838
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,192
Okay see if this works

839
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:03,776
Is crazy crazy idea works

840
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,720
Ono stayed on oops

841
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:27,072
Ya look at that data flow in

842
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,496
Totally ignoring our response

843
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:43,200
Okay time for me to go log into my router and open up a port

844
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:51,648
I am 11 163

845
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:07,264
How do you use netcat for as many connections as you want I want to make it so goes out to everybody who

846
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,696
And I hate using different passwords for things

847
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,352
Network

848
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:37,728
Anybody else know where that isn't open wrt

849
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,056
44 words

850
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:02,304
AutoZone other is 163

851
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,776
What

852
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,848
I've never heard of NC

853
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,896
The off

854
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,712
What that is

855
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:38,656
Get a chance so

856
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:45,056
You have the ls Impala type beats

857
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,408
A rotation around the x-axis

858
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,944
Left to right

859
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:55,296
If x changes

860
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:01,952
It is affecting what I consider to be the x coordinate so

861
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:08,352
It would be x-axis with the higher number so that the laser sweeping around the y-axis

862
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:14,752
Yeah yeah no forward from lighthouse

863
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:21,152
DX's forward from the Lighthouse Point of View in the lighthouse

864
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:27,296
Local coordinates to Lighthouse local coordinates klzs forward and then the sweep

865
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,344
Affects the x-axis

866
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:30,880
Okay

867
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:38,560
Thanks

868
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:51,360
What was something's weird

869
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:57,760
I am also going to make sure there are no

870
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:08,256
There should be no reflections

871
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:14,656
That should be fine

872
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:23,616
Did mess it up

873
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:53,568
Okay guys Connect into my IP and see what you guys get

874
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,576
This port 5555

875
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:35,296
Working for me I would like to know if it is working for you

876
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:23,680
Who you are getting dropped

877
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,264
Maybe I can open up my buffers thumb

878
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,640
I wonder if I'm just overflowing your connections

879
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:17,184
So the tweet that affect the x coordinate is called LAX

880
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,328
Yep that's the way I did it

881
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,168
That affect x-coordinate relative to the lighthouse

882
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:54,816
I don't know what's wrong with you Alex

883
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:59,424
I definitely understand the need to increase the buffer size though so

884
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:19,648
Does anyone else know the code off the top of their heads for increasing the buffer size

885
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,184
The send buffer size

886
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,384
Oh my gosh I don't want these balls of text I just want some see code

887
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,392
No comeback

888
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:37,632
Okay everybody connect back in should be fine now

889
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:44,032
Even the people who have the slower connections

890
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:56,832
What's your connection so slow that it just straight-up can't keep up

891
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:03,232
Nobody is reading Dana

892
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:09,632
Are we go

893
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:16,032
Whoever you are

894
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:22,432
Sad

895
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,760
Oh yes

896
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:02,880
Okay everybody Can I stack in should be fine now

897
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:09,280
Even people who have the slower connections

898
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:22,080
What's your connection so slow that it just straight-up can't keep up

899
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:28,480
My turn on nobody is reading data

900
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,880
Are we go

901
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:41,280
Whoever

902
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:47,680
Are you are you sad

903
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:19,680
They get going again guys can you see it

904
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:38,880
Think it's good okay

905
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,280
I think it actually might have been the TCP buffers that wrecked it up so I'm going to not put it at 65536

906
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:04,480
Okay that should widen up things so it should be fine

907
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:10,880
Just fine

908
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:17,280
Okay can you guys also connecting get some data looks like a few people are still cannot

909
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:23,680
Not many though I will turn this off so it reduces

910
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:30,080
Okay

911
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:36,480
No I definitely

912
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:42,880
I noticed I was doing the best I can to try to keep things going

913
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:49,280
Still dropping pretty quick

914
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:55,680
Maybe I actually need to go do some actual effort into making this

915
01:48:55,936 --> 01:49:02,080
Workwell

916
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:08,480
Don't really want to develop a hole

917
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:14,880
I don't know man I'll just add the server if when you guys went to go fix the server that would be soup

918
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:21,280
April Fool

919
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:27,680
He'll either way what I will do is

920
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:34,080
Add that to the thing

921
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:06,080
Oh man

922
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:12,480
How am I going to do this with

923
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:18,880
Stop showing my password

924
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:25,280
Hyatt down there enough

925
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:31,680
Over here

926
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:38,080
Dragon

927
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:44,480
Hoping that you guys don't see my password

928
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:50,880
Another window to always be in the front

929
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:57,280
Nope nope

930
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:03,680
I've gotten it's going to go totally just go hide that little bit

931
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:10,080
Okay

932
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:16,480
Careful now Charles

933
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:42,080
Goodgoodgood hahaha

934
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:48,480
Looks like all was well actually it is about time for an ad

935
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:54,880
Let me see all the way in the past there

936
01:51:55,136 --> 01:52:01,280
Does anybody else have anything that we shouldn't think we should go into right now or

937
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:07,680
Is now good time for an ad Dave how much longer you think is going to be till you get something

938
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:14,080
Okay that won't be that much longer.

939
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:20,480
Okay I guess I'll leave this up for a bit I'll play an ad and I'll be back in about 2

940
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:26,880
Two or three minutes

941
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:39,680
I didn't work

942
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:46,080
Echo

943
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:37,280
Actually no we can do is

944
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:43,680
She can watch Dave code

945
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:50,080
Planes actually can I can they watch you code is that okay if you want is everything

946
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:56,480
On your screen okaida broadcast there's there's nothing sensitive on the screen I have any passwords or

947
01:53:56,736 --> 01:54:02,880
Okay in Plainview and what I will do is you guys can watch Dave code

948
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:22,336
And Dave you can talk to them as you code do I have to

949
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:28,736
You can

950
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:35,136
So I made this really cool function that supposed to calculate which way the head now.

951
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:40,512
Directions are appointed relative to the lighthouse from the values of

952
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:43,328
Process

953
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:46,912
Yeah process data. Txt

954
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:51,776
And I've loaded all the head mount

955
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,848
Data and it looks like they're only really

956
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,152
Who values

957
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,456
That have

958
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:02,528
That have all of the angles

959
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:05,088
There's only two indices

960
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,160
Number 9 and number 30

961
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,720
That have an angle for

962
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:14,816
The both the left and the right

963
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,632
For both X and Y

964
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,680
So that fully defines

965
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:26,080
A direction from both lighthouses to the point what I'm wondering we can

966
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:32,480
Verify is whether those two lines intersect right whether both lighthouses

967
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:38,880
Exactly the same place though

968
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:45,280
I'm working on and so now that I've written that

969
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:51,680
I have to call that for those two

970
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:58,080
Lighthouses and then the next thing I have to do is

971
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:04,480
Use the orientation of lighthouses which I was plotting before which the orientation looks Plaza

972
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:10,880
Possible I'm not totally convinced that the way I'm fighting it is right but it look by the way they are

973
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:17,280
Kind of wackerly there like mounted like that from the wall so like this is why

974
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:23,424
Why and this is back the next day you were saying was forward though

975
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:29,824
Yeah but a black sozzi was forward for the lighthouse on on the way I was just playing and Z1

976
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:36,224
Was forward for both of them why I think Z was forward as in relatively toward the direction

977
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:42,624
If they had Mountain it was at least reasonably pointed in that way the way I was fly

978
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:49,024
The thing was that it looks like they're tilted down and on my plot it look like they were tilted

979
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:55,168
Almost straight forward not down at all which is why I'm wondering whether that might be wrong but

980
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,192
But we'll see

981
01:56:56,448 --> 01:57:02,592
Okay it's possible we also might be using different quaternion definition I can't remember if my 1st July

982
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:06,432
Value is my w that makes a difference here

983
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,248
00:00 looking

984
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:13,600
I couldn't see whether I was assuming was the last but if it's the first

985
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:17,184
Then that's a really easy thing to check

986
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:25,888
So here's the quaternion right here and it looks like all four of the values are roughly in

987
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:32,288
In the same reasonable range so it could be any one of them

988
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:39,968
Let me look up which one is which because that actually makes a difference

989
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:42,784
You couldn't think that simple

990
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:06,592
Does anybody else's got no at the hockey is to like go to the beginning of the line on OS X cuz neither of us know what it is

991
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:12,992
The old xyzw WXYZ problem.

992
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:32,192
I need to find this pf454 Mac there is no

993
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:38,592
Home button yeah the whole story behind the Mac is

994
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:44,992
That I'm teaching a class on programming and some of my students have Windows and some have

995
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:52,416
So I needed to make sure I had a Windows and Mac so that I

996
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:58,816
Help install code on all my students computers and

997
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:03,680
I have a Windows PC but it it's been six years and it's just got all this

998
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:10,080
Clumsy all these demons and everything running and it doesn't like that I don't like having a virus scanner

999
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:16,480
I think that's even worse than having a virus so it's just really

1000
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:22,880
Play old and slow so as backwards as it feels I feel like the Mac is is a little bit

1001
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:26,464
More and more productive on the Mac because

1002
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,512
It just doesn't bog down yet

1003
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,048
But I'm sure it will be

1004
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:36,192
One of these commercial operating systems Linux is better

1005
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,032
Effort

1006
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:47,712
Josh wants to know if you're teaching at UMBC no actually I'm teaching

1007
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,248
Teaching

1008
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:54,112
A small group of

1009
01:59:54,624 --> 02:00:00,768
Mostly like teenagers like to 12 to 15 year olds

1010
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:07,168
I'm teaching them see and I'm also teaching a little bit of object-oriented design and

1011
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:13,568
We have tried to make things fun I mean would we try to have some of the examples with

1012
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,616
Opengl

1013
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:18,944
One thing that was really neat

1014
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:25,344
Last class I was trying to teach them about 50 move you out until you get the

1015
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:29,184
Actually I want to do something else anyway real quick though

1016
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,256
You can go pull up whenever you want and then once it's out here

1017
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,144
One thing I wanted to do in my code

1018
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:41,472
Palm was I wanted to

1019
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:47,872
By the way I said

1020
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:52,992
Function left and function right unless you're in terminal in which case is Ctrl a

1021
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:57,600
Function function

1022
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:02,208
But in the terminal is control at okay yeah thanks remember

1023
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:24,992
So can you put me back on the

1024
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:31,136
I wanted to just do this one thing here

1025
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:38,048
Oh that's not good

1026
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:43,424
What is it that's fine

1027
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:51,616
Hello weird that they buffer out to exactly 10424 chunks

1028
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:58,016
People who are connected by whatever if you can tell me if the data being chucked you as reasonable that be

1029
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,040
Super cool

1030
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:05,952
Cuz the fact that they're all 1024 is a little bit suspicious

1031
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:10,560
Okay got it. Now showing your thing

1032
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:16,960
Oh yeah so I was I was teaching teaching the kids about how to load a file and I was like what is the absolute coolest

1033
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:23,360
Nothing you can do to just load a file so they had to make a model loader and

1034
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:29,760
I made things a little bit easier on them because I downloaded this obj model from

1035
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:34,112
I don't remember who the tribute to but I accept

1036
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:40,512
They do have a tribution to the to the creator of the model but I wrote a program that converted

1037
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:42,304
Obj models into

1038
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:47,936
A really simplified format it's just just the

1039
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,240
One vertex after another

1040
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:54,080
And the students had to learn how to open the file

1041
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,872
Mitzi

1042
02:02:56,128 --> 02:03:02,272
And then they had to allocate the array and then they had to make a for Loop to draw every

1043
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,576
Triangle you know the code

1044
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:11,232
If you got to learn how to how to read files you have to do something something cool with it

1045
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:17,376
We did that and we did a particle example they had to figure out how to

1046
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:23,776
How to work with large arrays cuz that's what what a particle besides it's instructive but

1047
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:30,176
You're not the same time try to make the all the concept but try to make it fun at the same

1048
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:37,344
That's what I'm doing and I'm not it's not it's not what I do you know primarily

1049
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,672
And I'm a software engineer causes a software engineer

1050
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:47,072
But you know what something that you know I enjoy teaching people and it's fun and then if you can help with kids

1051
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:49,120
I think that's that's a good thing song

1052
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:55,008
Going to go real quick back over tomorrow I think something's wrong with

1053
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,568
I have too many tabs open or something

1054
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:03,968
Everything is going super slow when I have your screen up notification

1055
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:08,576
Well

1056
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:13,184
Oh who ever that is

1057
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,464
Auto

1058
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:18,048
UCM flyback

1059
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,568
CR and LF in putty

1060
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:15,136
Jack your back alive

1061
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:17,696
I'm still trying to figure out whether is quaternion

1062
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:20,256
Is one way or the other

1063
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:26,656
It's in Lynn Mass. Each

1064
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:33,568
Cool macro that prints it out but I still have to figure out which way is which

1065
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:44,320
It looks like W2 last one

1066
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:46,112
Because

1067
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,928
You plot you print out three

1068
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,232
And it's just your 12

1069
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:55,328
And then when you print out 480 123

1070
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:58,144
But if you'd 012 or XYZ

1071
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:04,032
60/12 is just if you're printing out a point ASAP at 4.

1072
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:09,664
Yeah but usually if it's a point that's because people use the ijk

1073
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,040
Directions and leave w0

1074
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:27,840
Looking okay so quiet non is 1000

1075
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:35,264
Happy WXYZ

1076
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:40,640
Fix that I don't know I didn't think to check their first don't know what I did was I just checked quat's that none

1077
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:44,736
And then sitting on his 1000

1078
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:51,136
Let me let me fix that and I wonder why I mean the core the orientations weren't perfect

1079
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:57,536
But they weren't that terrible so I'm surprised that it

1080
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:01,120
I got those backwards rotation Zara wacky thing

1081
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,808
Nope going back to you now

1082
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:25,696
All right so I am now loading W and then i j k

1083
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,976
Can we see what that looks like

1084
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:35,424
Unless I wrote code that has compilers which I did

1085
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:38,752
That has to be fixed before we can see what it looks like

1086
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:49,760
The Discord is more for whenever like you have ideas or you want to work with other people about like

1087
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:56,160
Data or anything like that you can go there I also do virtually all of the announcements for the project like whenever I

1088
02:07:56,416 --> 02:08:02,560
I get something new or something news going on or some section the date is working I'll always announce it in Discord

1089
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:04,352
That's just what we used

1090
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:17,920
Look beautiful look at those hello look what is what is what is

1091
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:24,320
What is y4u oh

1092
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:30,720
Oh yeah

1093
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:34,816
There look at that so that's the the lighthouse

1094
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:41,472
You can't put the screen up now I can't physically to laptop

1095
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:47,872
Yeah I kind of rotate it that way

1096
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:54,272
Little bit down so Riley and the wires are pointing out

1097
02:08:54,528 --> 02:09:00,672
Yeah the wise are pointing out to the side that's perfect

1098
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:03,488
So went pretty good

1099
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:08,096
At least visualizing that still want to make

1100
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:12,960
Of the range and bearing angles to those two sensors

1101
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:17,312
That are actually observed by both lighthouses

1102
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:23,712
To make sure that both sensors that. Make sure those lines intersect right and what days talking to

1103
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:30,112
About is the center origin is defined the the the HTC Vive headset

1104
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:36,512
But the the Watchmen themselves were also on during that time so they kind of have their own opinion of where they could

1105
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:40,096
And so he's going to try to plot the location right

1106
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:46,240
I wasn't not the Watchmen so I was looking at the

1107
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:52,640
Although I mean the Watchman would be really good but if you look at the head-mounted display these

1108
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,688
Did they show up

1109
02:09:55,712 --> 02:10:01,856
You can see that what your York you can see in the display what you're doing all the head-mounted displays

1110
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:07,232
From process data and it looks like only two of them had the l x l y

1111
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,536
RX and Ry

1112
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:15,936
Only two of the IDS but those two IDs have enough information to draw

1113
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,472
Actual line

1114
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:20,288
Range and bearing through that

1115
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:23,104
Are there any Watchmen things that you can do that with

1116
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,920
I didn't look at the Watchmen

1117
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,480
Let me let me look

1118
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:34,880
Okay well regardless you can still do it for the 80s

1119
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:41,280
And it could be a factor if it works perfectly for the hmd it could just be a factor of like

1120
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,560
Calibrating

1121
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:48,960
To the point that would make that look right even if it's not actually wouldn't mind that you were talking about how

1122
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:55,104
The angle of the sensor has to be pointed roughly like

1123
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,896
Toward the lighthouse

1124
02:10:57,152 --> 02:11:03,296
Yes so that means that there just weren't very many sensors that were pointed enough toward both lighthouses for

1125
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:05,856
Both to be seen if that's possible

1126
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,648
That makes sense

1127
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:14,048
But either way at least we have these two points so I want to plot these two lines right

1128
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,376
Thing is even if those lines line up perfectly

1129
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:21,216
It might not be that it might not tell you that much because

1130
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:27,616
I may have already like bias the data of where I think the lighthouses is in such a way that would make those line line

1131
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:34,016
Yeah yeah I totally agree that.

1132
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:40,416
The data

1133
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:43,488
Like that that is actually like legitimate data like

1134
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:49,888
That there's no misunderstanding as to what the angles mean yeah where's that they disagree means that there is a misunderstanding

1135
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:52,704
Exactly so I want to make sure that

1136
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:59,104
I want to make sure that there's also not a problem with my code too so

1137
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:05,504
So yeah so yeah I'm calculating the planes intersect the plane

1138
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,576
Sorry I'm back on your screen now

1139
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:11,904
I need to call the function that does all of that

1140
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,744
Cuz that's exciting

1141
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:19,072
If I can do the live stream thing on my

1142
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:22,656
Phone and then chat there're monitor chat on that

1143
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:27,776
Do I not have YouTube on my phone

1144
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:40,064
Do you want to keep you up or whatever you want to do

1145
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,392
What are you up to now

1146
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:50,048
I'm not actually up to anything right now

1147
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,352
Your life keep going okay

1148
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,632
Yeah

1149
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,960
So that's what we're doing here

1150
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:00,288
Is plotting the X and Y

1151
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,360
Calculate those directions

1152
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:10,016
And then we're going to put that into a

1153
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:16,416
For Rob for the laugh

1154
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:35,616
Then we have to do the same thing for the right lighthouse

1155
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:54,816
Between maybe it has to do with the quality settings actually seems like

1156
02:13:55,072 --> 02:14:01,216
Time for me to go drink with that

1157
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:14,016
Quickly disconnects real quick

1158
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:26,816
Gospel login sorry

1159
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:39,616
And I can see you typing in Bud call CRC

1160
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:46,016
Try moving around now see if it's nice and smooth ER

1161
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:58,816
Looks a little better oh yeah it's definitely

1162
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:11,616
Plug these into the quaternions

1163
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:18,016
By the way I mean right now since I'm kind of freaking out

1164
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:24,416
I was a pretty good time for us to start like actually chat chatting unless my chat

1165
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:30,816
That is grossly out of date or something I just did not catch it

1166
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:37,216
Nope looks like I'm up-to-date with chat

1167
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:50,016
I got my solder paste from digikey

1168
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:56,416
I did it to reasonable price and it's they always ship it in the nice like refrigerated packet

1169
02:15:56,672 --> 02:16:02,816
Any other random questions

1170
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:09,216
I forget I mentioned earlier on but tomorrow hopefully at 6 p.m. I'm going to be opening this

1171
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:15,616
Box right here which if you guys do not know K or the people who

1172
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:22,016
Distribute the best multi M ever made and I'm going to attempt to be hacking Wi-Fi into it

1173
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:28,416
Tomorrow so don't know if that's going to work I have some ideas that I think might work but

1174
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:34,816
We'll have to find out live any other random thoughts or questions any

1175
02:16:54,272 --> 02:17:00,416
Oh

1176
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:06,816
Okay I guess I'll go into the the you know what that's a good point I'll spend

1177
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:13,216
In a minute I will go and do an explanation of everything and if you're up for doing this

1178
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:19,616
I'll try right now

1179
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:09,024
Oh I didn't too much. So linger

1180
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:15,936
Try it again

1181
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:35,392
Okay come on guys connect on intake a checkout at the

1182
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,440
The date and tell me if it's working

1183
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:38,624
Grief

1184
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,928
Can you not remember my credentials

1185
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:35,712
Okay I'll take a look at and see everything it's going

1186
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:42,368
Caso Anthony Monet

1187
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:46,720
I tried the socat that's what's running right now

1188
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,024
Tell me if the

1189
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,072
If the data looks good

1190
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,704
Looks like we should probably do recap in a minute

1191
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:15,136
Working but it seems slower but you're not getting random disconnects

1192
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:17,440
Data is slow

1193
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:23,840
Okay so maybe the snow cat thing really isn't working we actually just need to do something smart about it

1194
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,488
What

1195
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:54,048
In the world are you saying Chris Van ryn

1196
02:21:55,328 --> 02:22:00,448
Okay I guess now's a good time do you want to be live on the screen or do you want me to

1197
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:06,848
Keep it on this thumb well this should be exciting we have these lines and they're going to you down

1198
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,896
So there's something wrong

1199
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:12,480
But yeah that is wrong

1200
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:15,552
Is it possible that I could be

1201
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:20,416
- that the - is wrong I think what's going on

1202
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:23,488
Is that I flip X and Y somehow

1203
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:29,376
I think the xsuite has to be the wise sweet and wisely Pasadena TX waived

1204
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:35,776
That's possible because it looks like hold on green is Y and the gray

1205
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:40,896
Has the larger angle it seems like

1206
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:47,296
But yeah there's no reason why that should be

1207
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:53,696
Because we see a larger angle in the plane

1208
02:22:53,952 --> 02:23:00,096
In the yz-plane when there should be a larger angle

1209
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:06,496
DxD playing according to get numbers down here well not yeah

1210
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:12,896
Is that true

1211
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:19,296
It should be a larger in the XE plants receive these numbers here Alex is supposedly the XE

1212
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:25,696
And that should be 20° but the XD playing is red blue and I just don't see

1213
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:32,096
Jack is it exactly zero in the exe playing in might be so maybe there

1214
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:38,496
There's something wrong with it should be about zero in the XV plane should be about 0

1215
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:44,896
Not exe playing it says there should be 20 degrees -20 degrees so maybe

1216
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:51,296
X and Y are flipped flipped look at the pound calculator

1217
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:57,696
I'm doing something I think I'll do a recap then

1218
02:23:57,952 --> 02:24:04,096
Which by the way my goal is to make this stream only be

1219
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:10,496
A total of 3 hours in like 50 minutes cuz YouTube makes it a complete

1220
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:16,896
And edit them if they go over 4 hours so we won't be doing that

1221
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:23,296
Who will close some of the stuff too

1222
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:29,696
Do cats getting some broken pipe that's probably fine

1223
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:42,496
There's a bunch of stuff oh by the way about the OS no I've never developed my own OS

1224
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:48,896
I did actually create a raw bootable thing called my OS but that was just for

1225
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:55,296
Making it so I could run like raw code on a processor without grub or anyting it was just like x86

1226
02:24:55,552 --> 02:25:01,696
Straight up boo'd everything lives in a small space but it does move it into like a high graphics mode and

1227
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:08,096
A couple other things and put it into protected mode and all of that and it was for C+ plus and that was back when I was misguided and I

1228
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:14,496
Legitimate programming language omigosh someday

1229
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:20,896
Everybody is going to grow up and they're going to realize the sea is the only true path it's

1230
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:27,296
Just so sad how long of much of my life I wasted in C plus plus

1231
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:33,696
Anyway probably time to do the recap oh yeah the automatics

1232
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:40,096
Crlf it's it's under Section settings in putty or something like that

1233
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:46,496
Can't remember exactly where and I don't have putty so

1234
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:52,896
Moving on so this project this whole

1235
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:59,296
HTC Vive live survive project it was because

1236
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:05,696
In a hotel room while visiting aiyappa my friend grey cotton show

1237
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:12,096
A Vive and I was like yeah whatever I tried like all the VR

1238
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:18,496
They're all terrible I don't ever want to do VR this is just dombovy our Revolution is like the 3D printing Revolution is going to

1239
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:24,896
Going to go nobody's going to care that that's just what my attitude was as of before Thanksgiving

1240
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:29,760
And then he got out the lighthouses

1241
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:36,160
Any put them on little stands and I asked them what they were and he explained

1242
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:38,720
And I said oh

1243
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:43,072
Never mind about all of my opinions about VR

1244
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:44,608
That was just wrong

1245
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:49,216
The Vive is the future of VR.

1246
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,264
And that was when I just

1247
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:53,824
Like realize like this is something different

1248
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:55,360
And

1249
02:26:55,616 --> 02:27:01,504
About a half an hour later I was already on my laptop I was downloading all of the libraries forever working with the vibe

1250
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:08,672
And all of the existing ones were so chock-full of ridiculous dependencies Iran

1251
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:10,720
Update on my cell phone plan

1252
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:15,584
And that was the moment I got so frustrated I said I'm going to make my own

1253
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:22,496
And by me I mean all of you guys so live survive this project right here is an effort

1254
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:28,896
Kind of from the ground up in an OS agnostic manner without the use of additional live

1255
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:32,224
Libraries work with the HTC Vive

1256
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:38,624
Now personally I want to do it so that I can actually operate on other Hardware so things where it was steamed

1257
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:45,024
VR system doesn't exactly make sense I'd also like to be able to take this system that were developing here

1258
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:49,888
And be able to do things outside of the steamvr so I can hopefully operate the

1259
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:56,288
The five on my terrible laptop right here it's awful gut integrated Intel graph

1260
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:58,848
It's just depressing

1261
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:02,176
But I think I can get the bike to work on it

1262
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:08,832
Then when I get a project I want to do is I want to try direct ray-tracing inside the vibe using the V actual like

1263
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:10,112
Head Mount like

1264
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:16,512
The warping factors of all of the lenses as the mechanism that used to select the Rays used for reicast

1265
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:22,912
And I really would like to try to Port no Euclid over to the vibe I think that would

1266
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:23,936
A lot of fun

1267
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:30,336
I granted it would be pretty much unusable by anybody because it wouldn't use steam VR and therefore it's kind of a useless

1268
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,872
Thing

1269
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:32,640
But

1270
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:38,016
As far as like understanding it in digging in and learning more I think that's a lot of value

1271
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:44,416
Insofar as the whale I've survived could be used in the real world I'd really like to try to expand it out

1272
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:50,816
Outfield have custom sensors and custom system I'd like to be able to have systems that can save

1273
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:57,216
Handheld system that has an actual camera or not a camera an actual display on it to really kind of make

1274
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:03,616
More of an AR VR experience and be able to interact with people inside the VR

1275
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:10,016
There's just a lot of things that don't fit very well into the existing architectures that are being used by a lot of

1276
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:12,832
What is BR things that I really want to

1277
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:15,904
I really want to explore that I really want to try to have some fun with it

1278
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:22,304
And I also really like to bring in the esp8266 and esp32 into this

1279
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:33,312
They do you want to talk about anything or things just going south

1280
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:37,408
Just having a little bit of trouble with angles at the moment so

1281
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:44,064
I'm going to get that squared away

1282
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:49,952
What do you think your your angle so the way I did that the data sets is

1283
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:56,608
From the lighthouses point of view the angle side to side is very small

1284
02:29:56,864 --> 02:30:01,216
So like it should be they should be kind of an opposite sides pointed straight towards

1285
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:02,752
The

1286
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:09,152
Bhmd I'm going to go through a few tricks right now

1287
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:15,040
One thing I'm going to do is I'm going to set one of the planes equal to

1288
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:17,600
Equal to the the normal

1289
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:20,160
I'll set the

1290
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:26,048
It should be the most of what we're doing is in the LX it looks like

1291
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:28,608
Which means that

1292
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:30,144
Which one is X

1293
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:33,216
Axes up and down

1294
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:37,312
So what I'm going to do is it I'm going to sit

1295
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:40,896
Hawaii plane equal to the normal and just see why

1296
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:42,944
This thing is coming up weird

1297
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:49,856
I just noticed that Michael I rolled the my C plus plus statement

1298
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:52,928
I will admit I iconically

1299
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:59,328
I see most of that, clay like I do think people try to fit object orientation into way too many places

1300
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:05,728
But I know for small projects I honestly if I need something with a map I honestly just

1301
02:31:05,984 --> 02:31:09,568
Nothing wrong with like using C plus plus for things here and there

1302
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:12,640
There's really not that much wrong with even something like python

1303
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:20,064
Things get a little bit problematic for me when you move up to Java because that requires a lot more stuffed actually

1304
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:21,344
To go run the code

1305
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,904
But I'm not whatever that's fine

1306
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:28,256
Like they'll even Ronson embedded devices kind of so

1307
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:30,304
But no like I just

1308
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:34,912
Think that she should be strongly considered by most people as far as like

1309
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:37,984
Actually thinking about learning cuz when I did

1310
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,520
That opened up a lot

1311
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,568
Owosso Dave

1312
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:46,432
Trying to your conversion function for converting from the input into angles

1313
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:53,344
Converting from the input into angles yes you can see that but I found the problem oh nevermind

1314
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:59,744
For whatever reason I didn't set the real component of the lighthouse returnee in

1315
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:04,096
So let me know

1316
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:08,960
Let me add that that should be that shouldn't fix it

1317
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:15,104
And that's I'm only doing the XV cuz I still have that

1318
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:20,224
Oh hello wait what's going on I was weird it's a little bit of food

1319
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:23,040
That's certainly the biggest problem

1320
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:26,368
And then if I change the y&z back

1321
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:27,648
When was

1322
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:32,000
It still might be wrong but that was clearly a problem

1323
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,584
I got to slide you a little bit the side so the

1324
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:38,400
Define

1325
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:46,848
Close though really wrong they're pointed below

1326
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:49,920
Could still be

1327
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:52,480
That could still be wrong

1328
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:55,552
But it is showing

1329
02:32:56,320 --> 02:33:01,440
That the x-direction is most of the rotation which is right

1330
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:05,280
And it's showing that the y direction is the rest of it

1331
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:10,144
Can I see your function now sure

1332
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:17,056
For converting

1333
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:20,896
Big data in the file tornado

1334
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:31,904
But pie

1335
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:35,488
Call Matt what are you doing oh wait no that's wrong

1336
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:37,792
Why is that wrong 22nd

1337
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:40,096
That's wrong though I think

1338
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:46,496
V Pi * 2 / 200,000

1339
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:49,568
So I think

1340
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,872
But that's Pi / 200,000

1341
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:54,432
No it should be pie over sorry pie over

1342
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,784
100000 * pi

1343
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:03,904
Yeah that makes it easier for me to think about I think that's right

1344
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:08,768
Nope that's wrong

1345
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:10,816
Let's let's look at your code

1346
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:13,376
Organic a mycotopia code

1347
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:15,424
And if there's a difference

1348
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,728
Then one of them must be wrong right

1349
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,032
Obviously would be mine

1350
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:47,680
All right and my code is functionally this eau-de-vie

1351
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:54,080
So oh yeah I over

1352
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:59,200
So this would be 400400 oh my gosh

1353
02:35:00,224 --> 02:35:02,784
It is not the same I didn't see that / 2

1354
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:09,696
It was all the way on the side of the file and it might have been that my terminal is all scrunched

1355
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:16,096
Copper something and it went all the way to the second line

1356
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:28,896
Oh that's beautiful

1357
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:35,296
What's up with that it's hard to tell so there's a little bit of a difference but they

1358
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:41,696
They're both really good mm

1359
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:48,096
Although Lee that is right hold on can you

1360
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:54,496
Set happening maybe that I don't know that's really hard

1361
02:35:54,752 --> 02:36:00,896
Hard to tell it could be that my why rotation is wrong when I see about the route

1362
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:07,296
Is it enough that an error in the y Road

1363
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:13,696
Maybe I have the Y backwards

1364
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:20,096
Flip the wire round

1365
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:26,496
I flip the Y around

1366
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:32,896
Backwards then I guess I would have to

1367
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:39,296
Well people are saying stuff is one rotating in the other direction cause

1368
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:45,696
Are is the clothes clipping plane too far away have it set to a lower number

1369
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:58,496
I have something else now that's

1370
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:11,296
Just real quick so I think C+

1371
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:17,696
Ghostbusters okay and I think the STL is okay but if you think boost is a good idea and almost any kind of

1372
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:24,096
Any non-scientific programming environment I would disagree with

1373
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:30,496
Purpur Deployable Systems I think boost is way over used

1374
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:36,896
And as far as running Ubuntu on Windows

1375
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:43,296
I think that that is crazy and I have tried using it is so confusing and it is hilarious when you asked

1376
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:49,696
Cutie message

1377
02:37:49,952 --> 02:37:56,096
It is really sad that that cygwin never really got that far so

1378
02:37:56,352 --> 02:38:02,496
A little bit back to the

1379
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:08,896
The rotations rotating indica

1380
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:15,296
David is napping can I see your

1381
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:21,696
Figure this out

1382
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:47,296
Okay so if it would go the other way then we just get rid of one

1383
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:53,696
One of but not both of the

1384
02:38:53,952 --> 02:39:00,096
Or I could just sheep and just put like a

1385
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:06,496
Why at the very end but that would be totally cheetah

1386
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:12,896
And just to me

1387
02:39:13,152 --> 02:39:19,296
I'm right

1388
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:25,696
Yeah that's exactly the same thing

1389
02:39:25,952 --> 02:39:32,096
So now I'm that looks like it may be right

1390
02:39:32,352 --> 02:39:38,496
Maybe I'm plugging in the wrong number

1391
02:39:38,752 --> 02:39:44,896
How to check your clothes near clipping Plains near the

1392
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:51,296
The Heather playing making sure the close enough to to your eyeball that you

1393
02:39:57,952 --> 02:40:03,072
Meters away so I'm not I'm not drunk lines very long

1394
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:06,912
But

1395
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:11,008
Make sure

1396
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:13,312
LAX and lyr

1397
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:14,848
Different

1398
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:17,152
Is 1 lighthouse

1399
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:23,296
One of these are xry

1400
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:28,160
Call this

1401
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:42,496
I'm a big fan of printer

1402
02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:44,800
I think

1403
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:45,824
Printf

1404
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:47,872
Is the kind of thing

1405
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:49,920
Oh there we go

1406
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,992
Quiet what's wrong what

1407
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:54,784
This is the problem

1408
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,576
Why used

1409
02:40:56,832 --> 02:41:02,464
BL sweet angles for both lighthouses

1410
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:05,280
That would definitely be a problem

1411
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,912
Here we go pics

1412
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:16,288
Now the right Lighthouse uses the sweep angles from the right lighthouse

1413
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:19,360
I'll look at that look at that

1414
02:41:19,872 --> 02:41:24,736
Oh my gosh that's gorgeous that looks exactly right

1415
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:29,088
Well I mean

1416
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:33,440
Create intersection of those two points from two different lighthouses

1417
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:35,744
Is that exactly the same point

1418
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:38,816
That's a good thing

1419
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:42,400
I'm getting chills by the way that they look so good

1420
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:48,800
Right so that's that definitely validates that we're not doing something obviously wrong

1421
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:55,200
I mean it could be that they're both consistently wrong but I definitely look

1422
02:41:55,456 --> 02:42:01,088
Plausible given where they're heading out is and and also

1423
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:08,000
Where the lighthouse is all right it looks like it looks like we're in business

1424
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:14,400
Cool

1425
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:20,800
So then the next thing I guess the next thing I know yeah we wanted me to try to do that

1426
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:27,200
Hint

1427
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:33,600
Near all is saying something

1428
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:40,000
I don't know why I can't click enter

1429
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:46,400
That's not working but whatever Mike if you can see the see the stuff that's in my text there

1430
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:52,800
Near all is pointing out that you know what I'll just say it out loud

1431
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:54,848
Cuz I can't click enter

1432
02:42:55,104 --> 02:43:01,248
My my frustration with a lot of development environment has to do with the amount of size that the development Byron takes up

1433
02:43:01,504 --> 02:43:07,648
The amount of sides of the executables take up the length of time it takes to compile and there's a lot of things you might think like woo-hoo

1434
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:14,048
What really causes a lot of problems like when I give somebody Arduino environment and it actually takes

1435
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:14,816
Computer like

1436
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:18,400
12 seconds to compile it every time they want to change something

1437
02:43:18,656 --> 02:43:20,448
That's really detracting so like

1438
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:26,848
Ipsy plus plus was really fast in compiling and execution then that would be

1439
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:33,248
No big reason to use it and I'll admit a lot of the reason it's slow has more to do with historical reasons than current reason so it's not really against the law

1440
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,320
Moving on

1441
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:42,976
Oh my gosh so much stuff the a big thing that that just happened

1442
02:43:43,232 --> 02:43:48,608
Are all pointed out do you use the face State ho no

1443
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:49,632
Where is it

1444
02:43:56,032 --> 02:44:00,128
Do you use the base station Factory calibration data yet

1445
02:44:00,384 --> 02:44:05,248
EG the rotor FaZe offset akf calda and phase

1446
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,272
No

1447
02:44:06,528 --> 02:44:11,392
I have never heard of it until right now I don't know where to get it

1448
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:14,464
I don't even know what it's part of

1449
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:20,864
You can tell me where to find it and what to do with it that would be super

1450
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:21,632
Cool

1451
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:25,472
Add an addition you could also then drop that into the

1452
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:27,008
Data processor

1453
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:30,848
Which could then make it so be applied to everything

1454
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:40,064
Going to need at least phase soon what is FaZe

1455
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:43,136
What is this phase thing

1456
02:44:45,952 --> 02:44:47,488
Going to need it soon

1457
02:44:55,168 --> 02:44:56,960
I don't know what npm is

1458
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:59,520
So

1459
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:02,080
Maybe

1460
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:07,456
Merrill or or

1461
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:13,856
Or Allen if either of you guys are interested in explaining what this face thing is about to say like a quick

1462
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:20,256
Webcam video or something like a like on YouTube just post it to YouTube like a quick 2-minute video explaining it

1463
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:24,608
45-minute or whatever I think it'd be a lot of fun for us to watch that here

1464
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:31,008
So if you guys want to go like explain it or something like that

1465
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:32,800
Would be pretty cool

1466
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:38,432
Cuz I don't know anything about it I would just be reading the otx page as it goes

1467
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:47,136
Stop posting Discord you're not up for it you're not up for explaining it

1468
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:53,536
Josh Allen wants me to move the headset around

1469
02:45:54,048 --> 02:45:57,632
And to see the data in real time

1470
02:45:58,144 --> 02:45:59,936
How hard would it be

1471
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:03,519
For you to I know this is not an immediate change

1472
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:06,079
For you to connect

1473
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:10,431
To my demon which is streaming out the XYZ data

1474
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:11,967
Unreal time

1475
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:13,247
Beyond

1476
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:19,135
Draw the lines in your in your space based on that data

1477
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:23,231
Hold on so you want me to connect to your demon yes

1478
02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:26,815
And your demon is on that machine

1479
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:30,399
So you're talkin about like a socket

1480
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,959
So you can connect by the socket

1481
02:46:33,215 --> 02:46:38,079
And that if possible and real-time just draw the lines coming from the lighthouses

1482
02:46:38,591 --> 02:46:40,127
Are the X and Y lines

1483
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:45,503
Of of where the headset would be in 3D space

1484
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:47,551
Based on those lines

1485
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:50,623
Yeah I don't think that would be

1486
02:46:51,135 --> 02:46:53,695
Are you running it on this machine guess

1487
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:57,535
And the demon

1488
02:46:57,791 --> 02:46:59,071
That you're running

1489
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:05,471
Which word program so you can actually what you can do if you have like

1490
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:11,871
Batter something I'm going to just see temp test data. See

1491
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:18,783
Is Jack points out you can stream it in by the console so I can

1492
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:21,855
I can say lb include stdio.

1493
02:47:28,255 --> 02:47:30,303
What's going on up there we go

1494
02:47:33,631 --> 02:47:35,423
123

1495
02:47:40,031 --> 02:47:43,103
Yeah this weird that it really is a lot slower with us

1496
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,271
Dumb

1497
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:55,135
Stephanie's going to add give me a second guy sorry sorry Dave Hold On

1498
02:48:00,255 --> 02:48:03,071
I have to add this to the to do so we don't forget about it

1499
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:09,471
Am I still on the on the is my console still up

1500
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:11,775
Okay

1501
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:14,847
I will not go back to your console

1502
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:42,495
I'm a little bit confused as to why any kind of factory calibration information would be needed

1503
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:45,567
For the lighthouses considering

1504
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:49,663
I mean unless there's nonlinearities within the sweep

1505
02:48:50,687 --> 02:48:55,807
Like it moves faster in certain parts of the sweep and less fasted others

1506
02:48:56,319 --> 02:49:00,927
I don't understand why such a system would be necessary to have any calibration

1507
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:03,743
That's that's very confusing to me

1508
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:11,423
Yeah I don't I don't understand it but I'll comment this and I'll click on the link now

1509
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:21,407
Phase four rotors eurofase 4 rotor one

1510
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:24,991
Tiltrotor zero Telfer rotor one

1511
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:32,927
Oh man we are going to have to start decoding the otx stuff

1512
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:37,279
Bummers I didn't want to do that

1513
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:44,191
Apparently we will there's otx information that comes between coated and data that you don't get but that I get

1514
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:51,103
That comes from the beta the lighthouses and what is OOTD

1515
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:54,943
00:00 TX

1516
02:49:56,735 --> 02:49:58,527
What does OTS mean

1517
02:49:58,783 --> 02:50:04,927
The name is made up find a real name OK what is otx mean

1518
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:11,327
Lighthouses

1519
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:17,727
Pulses impulses can either be long or short and buy depending on whether the sink faucets

1520
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:19,263
Being long or short

1521
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:21,823
It actually encodes data that way

1522
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:28,223
You'll actually like like a 10-10 it transmits it very slowly but over time

1523
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:32,575
You can actually receive from both base stations Apolo TX message

1524
02:50:32,831 --> 02:50:35,135
That will give you a ton of information about it

1525
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:37,951
Including whatever phase 4 rotor one

1526
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:40,255
Oh neat

1527
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:45,119
Omnidirectional Optical transmission how is it omnidirectional

1528
02:50:45,631 --> 02:50:46,143
Is it just

1529
02:50:46,655 --> 02:50:48,447
Omni is so like not

1530
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:54,079
Geographically know

1531
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:56,127
Cheo

1532
02:50:56,639 --> 02:51:00,991
Geometry not geometrically omnidirectional not

1533
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:04,063
Datum Direction omnidirectional

1534
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:07,391
Make a note for that one for narrow

1535
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:19,423
Josh you're just going to have to join us one of these days for these live stream

1536
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:25,823
You're only like an hour and a half away and I know you're not even an hour and a half away

1537
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:32,223
Set includes curve orientation gibbous

1538
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:38,623
FaZe

1539
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:42,463
I'm sure that if virologist knows that all of these things are but

1540
02:51:48,863 --> 02:51:49,631
What

1541
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:52,703
Convex or protuberant

1542
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:53,983
Phase of the

1543
02:52:33,663 --> 02:52:35,711
I was totally working on something somewhere

1544
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:38,015
Terminal

1545
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:40,831
Terminal ok

1546
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:47,999
Is it okay if I have your screen up some

1547
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:54,399
Years ago you won't need two sockets by the way

1548
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:04,383
So Josh had mentioned that we should be using that you can use netcat to just type it in by standard in

1549
02:53:05,663 --> 02:53:08,735
How do I do that I'm about ready to send you an example

1550
02:53:35,871 --> 02:53:40,479
So will your code block until I receive the data

1551
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:48,415
Oh that would be annoying for you wouldn't understand weather

1552
02:53:55,839 --> 02:53:59,423
I'm just trying to understand what the behavior is so I

1553
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:04,031
Can be guaranteed to read the first float first

1554
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:11,455
Write 20 in the first part first I won't receive this dream in the middle all start with the beginning of History

1555
02:54:12,223 --> 02:54:13,503
Putting beginning

1556
02:54:13,759 --> 02:54:15,295
When you start typing data

1557
02:54:15,807 --> 02:54:21,951
You will get a message it once I will say the x-axis from this this one is this Valley

1558
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:29,631
Yes yes yes so I won't the first thing I read will not be in the middle of a line that will be the beginning

1559
02:54:29,887 --> 02:54:35,007
Correct

1560
02:54:40,895 --> 02:54:46,783
But then when your code is sending data at your code will be blocking until I actually receive it right

1561
02:54:49,599 --> 02:54:53,183
Your code is running

1562
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:56,255
Prince2 netcat I guess

1563
02:54:57,535 --> 02:54:58,559
But then

1564
02:54:58,815 --> 02:55:00,863
Once it starts printings netcat

1565
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:03,935
Netcat does not complete the print statement

1566
02:55:04,447 --> 02:55:05,215
Until my

1567
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:07,263
Program receives the

1568
02:55:15,967 --> 02:55:16,991
I don't understand

1569
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:21,599
So

1570
02:55:22,367 --> 02:55:24,415
If I start netcasting it in

1571
02:55:24,671 --> 02:55:26,975
I'm going to receive the very first

1572
02:55:31,839 --> 02:55:35,167
No you're able it will make sure a trunk some

1573
02:55:35,423 --> 02:55:40,031
The way I bought for the things so that it won't guarantee it will give you lines at a time again

1574
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:43,871
But your code will be dumping outlines before I even connect

1575
02:55:44,127 --> 02:55:44,639
Yes

1576
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:46,687
And that's okay

1577
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:51,295
You can use S Canna by the way

1578
02:55:51,551 --> 02:55:53,855
Yeah and I told I just tested it is working

1579
02:55:55,135 --> 02:56:01,279
I should be able to just use regular skin do you have

1580
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:03,071
Can you check real quick

1581
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:04,351
I can't

1582
02:56:06,143 --> 02:56:09,983
By the way I just so I have it on the Stream

1583
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:12,799
Alan says

1584
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:19,199
I don't like the name to be honest centricity would be have been better without the cowl you should be able to get some kind of

1585
02:56:19,455 --> 02:56:24,575
Tracking it will just suck well you know what for right now terrible is fine until we get moving more

1586
02:56:27,903 --> 02:56:29,439
I should buffer a little

1587
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:31,999
I guess it'll be a little bit of buffering

1588
02:56:32,767 --> 02:56:37,119
That young Fine Again by the way I do not have netcat

1589
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:39,423
You have a soak at

1590
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:43,263
Cfnc

1591
02:56:43,519 --> 02:56:45,567
Yes

1592
02:56:45,823 --> 02:56:51,967
Connect me let's make sure it works how do I do this on empty space when I

1593
02:56:52,223 --> 02:56:55,551
921 6811 163

1594
02:56:55,807 --> 02:57:01,951
Nono 192 168 168

1595
02:57:02,207 --> 02:57:04,255
11:11 153

1596
02:57:04,767 --> 02:57:06,815
And

1597
02:57:08,351 --> 02:57:14,495
And space it wasn't it wasn't updating on my screen 55555555

1598
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:21,919
Up there you go

1599
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:25,247
Cool cats really weird with that

1600
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:29,599
Yeah I'm going to do I'm going to try

1601
02:57:29,855 --> 02:57:31,135
Terminated

1602
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:33,183
But I just killed it

1603
02:57:33,695 --> 02:57:34,975
Try true

1604
02:57:36,511 --> 02:57:38,047
Doesn't seem terribly smoothie

1605
02:57:38,303 --> 02:57:41,631
Something's weird maybe that doesn't matter so much

1606
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:48,799
Conference weird why is it crashing

1607
02:57:49,055 --> 02:57:49,567
Can you put it

1608
02:57:49,823 --> 02:57:51,359
I'm still on your

1609
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:58,015
I think I would have to make them suffer no it would justify whatever the most recent is cuz I can just move it

1610
02:57:58,271 --> 02:58:04,415
Wait it's just going to be late for now

1611
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:10,815
Is a timestamp built into the the date of the first second third fourth fourth grade element

1612
02:58:11,071 --> 02:58:12,351
But don't worry about that

1613
02:58:12,607 --> 02:58:17,727
Yeah that sounds good alright so let me let me hacks of things together then

1614
02:58:43,327 --> 02:58:48,447
That was

1615
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:54,079
I hate s Olinger I hate s Olinger I hate s Olinger

1616
02:58:54,335 --> 02:58:56,383
So what do I have to do

1617
02:58:57,407 --> 02:59:01,759
And yeah it looks like a try it again try the NC thing again

1618
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:03,551
Yeah

1619
02:59:04,575 --> 02:59:06,879
Yeah let's just not use that so cat

1620
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:09,439
For a while can we use NC

1621
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:14,559
You're fine keep using what you're doing for the sender you can't use unsay

1622
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:23,775
If somebody doesn't mind working on my copy of the the data server and making it so can buffers

1623
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:25,823
Stop batter that would be really cool

1624
02:59:26,079 --> 02:59:32,223
Cuz I think that's what's going on and I think that as soon as someone as soon as you like

1625
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:36,063
Run out of data to States put it in and just drop it on the floor

1626
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:45,791
Yeah I know if that's the linger reuse addresses for primarily for UD.

1627
02:59:46,047 --> 02:59:47,327
Right or

1628
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:49,119
Or is it for TCP

1629
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:51,423
Address

1630
02:59:52,703 --> 02:59:58,847
Yeah real good Anna Moana and a Moen a if you want to go give that a shot that be cool

1631
02:59:59,103 --> 03:00:05,247
Do you mind if I have your screen up

1632
03:00:05,503 --> 03:00:11,647
Show right now

1633
03:00:31,103 --> 03:00:37,247
You know if you working

1634
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:43,647
Side of the lighthouse 5 thing included in the folder

1635
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:50,047
So where is it

1636
03:00:50,303 --> 03:00:56,447
Yep there it is

1637
03:00:56,703 --> 03:01:02,847
That's my favorite

1638
03:01:03,103 --> 03:01:09,247
Except for live survive

1639
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:22,047
All I have to do is just add the. See if I'll tonight

1640
03:01:35,103 --> 03:01:41,247
Can you move this window all the way to the left all the way to the lab

1641
03:01:41,503 --> 03:01:47,647
Everybody okay or actually or leave it there and I can

1642
03:01:47,903 --> 03:01:54,047
Truncate the left part of your screen good now everything's visible

1643
03:01:54,303 --> 03:02:00,447
Actually I heard somewhere that the light

1644
03:02:00,703 --> 03:02:06,847
Lighthouse does have a

1645
03:02:07,103 --> 03:02:13,247
Yeah Josh I typed those in cuz

1646
03:02:13,503 --> 03:02:19,647
I was being dumb yeah I think it has an accelerometer so that it can at least tell

1647
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:26,047
Internally which way did thinks this down which could potentially make the determination

1648
03:02:26,303 --> 03:02:32,447
Haitian for you could use its accelerometer

1649
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:38,847
What are data to more precisely determine its position because we can very precisely determine the shell

1650
03:02:39,103 --> 03:02:45,247
We'll tell you where on the shell it is so yeah that would be really cool for you

1651
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:51,647
Accelerometer for it

1652
03:02:51,903 --> 03:02:58,047
Okay

1653
03:02:58,303 --> 03:03:04,447
Sounds like we need to deal with the otx stuff fine

1654
03:03:04,703 --> 03:03:10,847
Thanks Mom

1655
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:23,647
Okay Alex well Dave's doing that I'll explain why the the accelerometer datamyte

1656
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:30,047
I can get it too so

1657
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:36,447
You look at the actually know what I'm going to do is on a pull-up bar

1658
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:42,847
Box of plastic

1659
03:04:08,703 --> 03:04:14,847
So this right here is the graph of the probabilities of where the our lighthouse could be

1660
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:21,247
I'm in Otis house are really nice shell one of the things that could be really done though is

1661
03:04:21,503 --> 03:04:27,647
You could more precisely determine where possible locations would be for where the

1662
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:34,047
Wherever you call it where it where the lighthouse could be

1663
03:04:34,303 --> 03:04:38,911
Based on that she'll so mean when I go clear it up a little bit so Tuesday 6

1664
03:04:41,727 --> 03:04:44,031
Probably not the best number of try

1665
03:04:49,663 --> 03:04:51,711
Hello

1666
03:04:53,503 --> 03:04:54,015
Hello

1667
03:05:00,927 --> 03:05:02,719
My laptop is dying

1668
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:09,375
That's weird that's a lot worse than I was expecting

1669
03:05:11,423 --> 03:05:12,703
What's up with that

1670
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:27,807
I'm not sure why these graphs look so terrible that's very confusing

1671
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:41,887
Are you stringing out to the

1672
03:05:43,167 --> 03:05:44,191
Nonton streaming you

1673
03:05:44,447 --> 03:05:44,959
Okay

1674
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:47,519
Yeah that's cool

1675
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:50,335
That's a funny shape that's really cool

1676
03:05:53,151 --> 03:05:54,175
What causes that shape

1677
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:01,343
You get a chance

1678
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:06,719
Brentwood again

1679
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:09,535
Extreme you can just pack yourself

1680
03:06:12,095 --> 03:06:14,399
How do I

1681
03:06:17,471 --> 03:06:20,543
192 168 11

1682
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:24,639
1163

1683
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:36,415
What are the numbers which lighthouse

1684
03:06:36,671 --> 03:06:37,439
Which sweep

1685
03:06:42,047 --> 03:06:43,327
Make a note

1686
03:06:45,119 --> 03:06:47,167
Hmd or

1687
03:06:47,423 --> 03:06:48,191
Wmd

1688
03:06:49,983 --> 03:06:52,287
And then it is timestamp

1689
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:55,359
Heidi

1690
03:06:56,383 --> 03:06:58,431
Then it is

1691
03:06:58,687 --> 03:06:59,455
Scroll up song

1692
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:07,135
But actually it is exposed the next one down is the sink ID which can be used for otxo you

1693
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:09,695
Probably don't care about that

1694
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:16,607
Then it goes time and sweet would you really do parabelle no

1695
03:07:23,263 --> 03:07:27,615
The time in sweet as the one that converts to Ingles

1696
03:07:35,039 --> 03:07:41,183
LS3 Dash

1697
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:47,583
LOL I was about to come up with an idea that you guys could do

1698
03:07:47,839 --> 03:07:48,607
But

1699
03:07:49,631 --> 03:07:51,935
It wouldn't actually

1700
03:07:55,775 --> 03:08:01,919
I think if you want to be like LSM 303 cease or something you could actually get like North so that you could Orion people

1701
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:06,271
Said would be like pointing the Right Way Forward every time

1702
03:08:06,527 --> 03:08:08,319
But I also realize that doesn't matter

1703
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:14,719
And you probably North between all the devices you can least get them pointed whatever it's useless let's not think about that

1704
03:08:20,351 --> 03:08:24,191
New York closed voxels happen cuz it is destroying my laptop

1705
03:08:49,535 --> 03:08:50,047
Hand

1706
03:09:05,151 --> 03:09:06,687
Should I make you public now

1707
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:07,455
If you want

1708
03:09:07,711 --> 03:09:08,223
Okay

1709
03:09:08,735 --> 03:09:11,807
I'm just right now public data

1710
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:19,231
Now the people will get a chance to Heckle you

1711
03:09:19,487 --> 03:09:22,047
Move move your terminal more towards the

1712
03:09:22,303 --> 03:09:22,815
Alright

1713
03:09:23,071 --> 03:09:29,215
More toys make it so everything is pick pick a side and move everything to that side okay

1714
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:35,103
And I will cut your email out

1715
03:09:42,015 --> 03:09:43,295
I was not visible by the way

1716
03:09:43,551 --> 03:09:47,903
So right now that terminal is off the screen to the left you want to move it right some

1717
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:49,695
Lucas one right yes

1718
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:52,767
There you go now everything is visible

1719
03:09:55,839 --> 03:09:57,887
I just

1720
03:09:58,399 --> 03:10:02,239
I'm reading in the thread and I'm trying to use proper

1721
03:10:02,495 --> 03:10:04,031
Programming practices

1722
03:10:04,543 --> 03:10:05,311
Into

1723
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:06,591
Lock

1724
03:10:07,103 --> 03:10:08,383
M mewtwo EX

1725
03:10:09,663 --> 03:10:11,711
Because the chair resource

1726
03:10:12,735 --> 03:10:16,063
You should not need that to update values in a buffer

1727
03:10:17,855 --> 03:10:20,671
Do you have it's okay Dave it's fine

1728
03:10:20,927 --> 03:10:22,207
Pulsar atomic

1729
03:10:23,487 --> 03:10:25,535
Yeah but there's three different floats

1730
03:10:27,071 --> 03:10:33,215
Yes whatever

1731
03:10:36,543 --> 03:10:40,639
I'm also using a good programming practices

1732
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:44,479
By putting my shared resource in a global variable

1733
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:49,599
That way both threads can access the same data without having to pass it or not

1734
03:10:49,855 --> 03:10:50,623
It makes sense

1735
03:10:58,815 --> 03:10:59,839
You want any water

1736
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:01,631
I think I'm good

1737
03:11:04,191 --> 03:11:06,495
I have to copy the code

1738
03:11:06,751 --> 03:11:09,055
Slightly different from this other code

1739
03:11:09,311 --> 03:11:10,847
Dutch ecstasy

1740
03:11:39,007 --> 03:11:45,151
Global

1741
03:11:51,807 --> 03:11:57,951
And now I'm just like using bad programming practices

1742
03:11:58,207 --> 03:11:59,999
And

1743
03:12:00,255 --> 03:12:05,375
Ignoring my own pound of fines that enumerate the different values

1744
03:12:05,631 --> 03:12:07,679
And just

1745
03:12:08,191 --> 03:12:09,727
Hacking it out

1746
03:12:58,111 --> 03:13:04,255
The simultaneous sampling really matter that much if you have like a an interruption coming off of the IMU

1747
03:13:05,535 --> 03:13:11,679
Like I'm like an Allison 90s one or actual basically all St mems divide cinemaware

1748
03:13:11,935 --> 03:13:17,823
Have an interrupt pin that comes off as soon as the date is red so it's probably sufficient for

1749
03:13:19,359 --> 03:13:22,175
Probably sufficient for what you're after Reynard

1750
03:13:22,943 --> 03:13:26,783
Andrei not renewed pregnant

1751
03:13:33,951 --> 03:13:36,255
I don't even think you have to use an external clock

1752
03:13:41,887 --> 03:13:43,167
I'm about to

1753
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:45,471
I'm going to play an ad

1754
03:13:50,079 --> 03:13:52,639
I know some people not good at that is okay

1755
03:14:43,327 --> 03:14:49,471
What is your code look like now oh my good idea

1756
03:15:02,527 --> 03:15:08,671
I will admit that is one thing

1757
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:15,071
Really annoying about the AT&T devices is that like the Allison 90s one will have two of the things like

1758
03:15:15,327 --> 03:15:21,471
The accelerometer and the gyro synchronize but then the accelerometer is there sorry the magnetometers

1759
03:15:21,727 --> 03:15:27,871
Deceleration and the magnetism synchronize but then the Gyros like

1760
03:15:28,127 --> 03:15:32,223
Phone thing that operates at a completely different set a raise so I don't really understand that

1761
03:15:37,343 --> 03:15:41,439
Actually I'm really curious now

1762
03:16:01,663 --> 03:16:07,807
You don't necessarily need to rebuild the clock it'll still tell you when the events happened

1763
03:16:08,063 --> 03:16:14,207
Because the interrupt pin but

1764
03:16:14,463 --> 03:16:20,607
And honestly I don't think it matters that much considering the rates are usually High Enough

1765
03:16:20,863 --> 03:16:27,007
Oh actually remind me there's a way of triggering it I'm trying to read what it is there's like a next turn

1766
03:16:27,263 --> 03:16:32,639
Conversions

1767
03:17:14,111 --> 03:17:15,903
What is the trigger event

1768
03:17:22,815 --> 03:17:28,191
I guess I should take the flight I actually know I don't even really know what the lighthouses I know

1769
03:17:28,447 --> 03:17:31,519
But the lighthouses have an optical sensor right

1770
03:17:31,775 --> 03:17:35,103
But we just can't get the data back from it at any reasonable time

1771
03:17:35,615 --> 03:17:41,759
Point is if you have them in a sorry dandb mode one will become the mask

1772
03:17:42,015 --> 03:17:44,831
After the other one will synchronize from what I understand

1773
03:17:45,087 --> 03:17:48,671
Be like oh he flashed then I'll flash now

1774
03:17:59,167 --> 03:18:02,751
What's the data ready pin

1775
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:07,359
Odata enable

1776
03:18:09,151 --> 03:18:15,295
So I guess you just hook a date already am into data enable Ag and that should probably do

1777
03:18:15,551 --> 03:18:16,575
Something you want

1778
03:18:17,087 --> 03:18:19,647
And then you may not be able to control it

1779
03:18:19,903 --> 03:18:20,415
But

1780
03:18:21,183 --> 03:18:25,023
There is no denim right now there's no d e n

1781
03:18:29,119 --> 03:18:35,263
Accelerometer or gyroscope they'd enable yeah you can just totally regenerate everything you wanted from that in the magnetometer

1782
03:18:35,775 --> 03:18:37,823
And then you can get fully synchronize data

1783
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:41,151
And it could be what you're after

1784
03:18:42,175 --> 03:18:44,991
Love the elephant 90s one

1785
03:18:53,695 --> 03:18:55,487
We are watching you now

1786
03:19:05,215 --> 03:19:11,359
Such careful locking and unlocking your data structures Dave

1787
03:19:13,663 --> 03:19:16,223
Yeah Live Free or Die right

1788
03:19:16,479 --> 03:19:17,247
Okay

1789
03:19:17,503 --> 03:19:19,295
Theoretically

1790
03:19:20,063 --> 03:19:20,831
We're good

1791
03:19:22,367 --> 03:19:22,879
Okay

1792
03:19:23,647 --> 03:19:25,439
I've no idea what's going to happen

1793
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:27,487
I do

1794
03:19:27,743 --> 03:19:29,023
You're going to Tyler

1795
03:19:30,047 --> 03:19:31,583
Oh I didn't even think of that

1796
03:19:32,351 --> 03:19:32,863
Yeah

1797
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:35,167
By the way it's not that you have to use a pipe

1798
03:19:35,679 --> 03:19:41,567
Yeah I know but I can't even oh you got more compile errors

1799
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:46,687
The tenant to fix the compiler like this variable called Shay

1800
03:19:47,199 --> 03:19:48,479
Define

1801
03:19:49,759 --> 03:19:55,391
Arabic I thought the invention part had a worse RMS are than the Ellison part and it's like

1802
03:19:55,647 --> 03:19:57,439
Two or three times the price

1803
03:19:58,719 --> 03:19:59,231
I don't know

1804
03:20:12,287 --> 03:20:18,431
I just never trusted the events in part because it did so much magic junk behind the scenes that I didn't really know

1805
03:20:36,863 --> 03:20:43,007
Read hmd

1806
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:49,407
HMT angles

1807
03:20:56,063 --> 03:21:02,207
989 I must have copied and pasted the erroneous spelling

1808
03:21:02,463 --> 03:21:08,607
Someplace else

1809
03:21:08,863 --> 03:21:15,007
Oh I didn't know you turn that stuff off so the invention 60/50

1810
03:21:15,263 --> 03:21:21,407
Emu and it was I don't know what tonight

1811
03:21:21,663 --> 03:21:27,807
I knew that does a whole lotta magic inside of it that I don't I don't know I play with it for a while and I was like I don't

1812
03:21:28,063 --> 03:21:34,207
Really like what it's giving me until I started using the Allison 90s one it's a different IMU

1813
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:40,607
And Alan Yates just pointed out that you can just turn off all the stuff but the crazy

1814
03:21:40,863 --> 03:21:47,007
They do inside

1815
03:21:53,663 --> 03:21:59,807
I asked cat space type O I see you're doing

1816
03:22:06,463 --> 03:22:12,607
Diesel works

1817
03:22:12,863 --> 03:22:19,007
Can you move that over some I can't we can't see it there

1818
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:25,407
It's definitely not showing anything for whatever reason let me see what's going on

1819
03:22:25,663 --> 03:22:31,807
Now something's hosed I know it's going

1820
03:22:32,063 --> 03:22:38,207
Oii transfer problem I'm only going to

1821
03:22:38,463 --> 03:22:44,607
81 Lighthouse at it I'm only going to show one way right now

1822
03:22:44,863 --> 03:22:51,007
Stream was actually down weird

1823
03:22:51,263 --> 03:22:57,407
Disco fun times are you guys can't see it now you guys can use the thing over some

1824
03:22:57,663 --> 03:23:03,807
Disco fun time there's something weird going on let's just pick it up and move around

1825
03:23:04,063 --> 03:23:10,207
Oh hey oh that's a little bit crazy I need to make it

1826
03:23:10,463 --> 03:23:16,607
Phase-out overtime I'll put a frame numbers that keeps track of train

1827
03:23:16,863 --> 03:23:23,007
The last time was updated

1828
03:23:29,663 --> 03:23:35,807
Yeah

1829
03:23:36,063 --> 03:23:42,207
I'm not deleting old data let me let me to buy phase out the date

1830
03:23:42,463 --> 03:23:48,607
I would not have expected that

1831
03:23:48,863 --> 03:23:55,007
All right out the old data and if I do

1832
03:23:55,263 --> 03:24:01,407
If we haven't seen it in the last like for friends or something like that

1833
03:24:01,663 --> 03:24:07,807
At that autentica weightless by

1834
03:24:08,063 --> 03:24:14,207
Guys haven't seen it

1835
03:24:14,463 --> 03:24:20,607
He has googly eyes now

1836
03:24:20,863 --> 03:24:27,007
There we go now has eyes actually pointing in a reasonable Direction

1837
03:24:40,063 --> 03:24:46,207
Don't forget you can use

1838
03:24:46,463 --> 03:24:52,607
OG get absolute time is generic okay I can do that

1839
03:24:52,863 --> 03:24:59,007
That works too

1840
03:25:12,063 --> 03:25:18,207
What 0/0

1841
03:25:18,463 --> 03:25:24,607
Sorry that was me I'm due. Sorry that was me LOL something's hoes with

1842
03:25:24,863 --> 03:25:31,007
My laptop right now

1843
03:25:47,903 --> 03:25:48,671
The hack

1844
03:25:49,695 --> 03:25:51,743
I can't switch desktops anymore

1845
03:25:59,167 --> 03:25:59,935
There we go

1846
03:26:01,983 --> 03:26:05,823
Check time 3:37 so we still got 20 minutes left

1847
03:26:54,207 --> 03:26:54,975
So what's up

1848
03:26:55,231 --> 03:26:57,023
What's up what's going on

1849
03:26:57,279 --> 03:27:00,863
Oh I was just thinking about how to write multi-threaded programs

1850
03:27:05,471 --> 03:27:07,775
It's fine just don't worry about locks

1851
03:27:08,031 --> 03:27:14,175
Just don't lock it just set it back to zero like okay still like operations on the ends are all the Thomas

1852
03:27:14,431 --> 03:27:19,551
So you can just have them 20 and I just updated from somewhere else

1853
03:27:19,807 --> 03:27:22,367
Okay well then we'll just

1854
03:27:22,879 --> 03:27:25,183
If we're not worried about things

1855
03:27:25,439 --> 03:27:27,487
Then yeah we can do that

1856
03:27:27,999 --> 03:27:30,559
But I still should probably eat

1857
03:27:41,311 --> 03:27:44,127
Know somebody's

1858
03:27:44,639 --> 03:27:45,151
But

1859
03:27:46,175 --> 03:27:52,319
Why does Dave have to phase out all day. Okay so Josh the thing going on there Dave wants to

1860
03:27:52,575 --> 03:27:54,111
Phase out the old data

1861
03:27:54,367 --> 03:27:56,671
So that it's not

1862
03:27:57,183 --> 03:28:03,327
It's not shown still with line so like if you haven't seen a line in awhile I just doesn't show it anymore

1863
03:28:23,295 --> 03:28:24,831
Picture of the same data

1864
03:28:27,135 --> 03:28:28,671
Looks like it's still sending data

1865
03:28:36,351 --> 03:28:37,375
Then

1866
03:28:40,703 --> 03:28:45,055
It is it's just throwing out the older data

1867
03:29:07,583 --> 03:29:09,119

1868
03:29:10,655 --> 03:29:15,775
I'm just messing with you it's okay if we don't get it in time

1869
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:26,783
Oh by the way I didn't check are you making sure that if it's below if it's at zero it doesn't keep decrementing or incrementing or what

1870
03:29:30,111 --> 03:29:34,463
Oh wait no you're adding right you're sitting at 20 and then adding yeah we have like

1871
03:29:34,719 --> 03:29:37,791
4 billion frames we have a problem but other than that will be okay

1872
03:29:40,863 --> 03:29:41,631
Alright

1873
03:29:43,167 --> 03:29:44,447
I think that ought to do it

1874
03:29:53,663 --> 03:29:57,247
Change my name

1875
03:30:05,439 --> 03:30:06,207
What about you

1876
03:30:13,631 --> 03:30:15,679
Oh you can't have equals

1877
03:30:16,959 --> 03:30:17,727
That is true

1878
03:30:23,359 --> 03:30:25,407
Hmtv

1879
03:30:26,175 --> 03:30:30,783
Wait GCC does that are using clang

1880
03:30:31,039 --> 03:30:33,599
No I'm using GCC supposedly

1881
03:30:34,367 --> 03:30:36,927
I don't know whether

1882
03:30:38,719 --> 03:30:43,839
I don't know whether Apple somehow play sgcc is claims

1883
03:30:44,863 --> 03:30:48,447
Are the licenses compatible between the two

1884
03:30:48,959 --> 03:30:52,031
So that you can cut and paste code from one of the other I don't know

1885
03:31:04,575 --> 03:31:07,135
Close

1886
03:31:08,671 --> 03:31:09,439
Alright

1887
03:31:09,951 --> 03:31:11,487
This time it's going to run

1888
03:31:18,143 --> 03:31:24,287
I thought I had my myusername is all lower caps I guess I never I never never changed it

1889
03:31:24,543 --> 03:31:25,311
Alright

1890
03:31:27,615 --> 03:31:29,663
Oh that's that works great

1891
03:31:30,175 --> 03:31:30,687
Yeah

1892
03:31:31,711 --> 03:31:33,503
What the heck did I do wrong

1893
03:31:43,999 --> 03:31:49,119
Underscore ID to be outside of the range

1894
03:31:50,399 --> 03:31:51,679
I mean I can check that

1895
03:32:14,207 --> 03:32:15,487
Is anyone else DVR

1896
03:32:28,799 --> 03:32:34,943
And reynaud says that it's likely actually climbed even if it says she sees it

1897
03:32:35,711 --> 03:32:37,759
Yeah that's that would make sense to me

1898
03:32:44,159 --> 03:32:45,695
Freeway did you build a clean

1899
03:32:46,975 --> 03:32:49,279
Elway doesn't matter you are using C files

1900
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:54,143
Global

1901
03:32:54,655 --> 03:32:55,167
Well

1902
03:32:56,959 --> 03:32:57,983
Actually

1903
03:32:59,007 --> 03:33:00,031
I betcha

1904
03:33:03,871 --> 03:33:04,383
Why

1905
03:33:05,407 --> 03:33:07,455
Won't

1906
03:33:10,783 --> 03:33:14,111
Disco.

1907
03:33:14,623 --> 03:33:16,927
Play I don't see how that could cause a problem

1908
03:33:17,183 --> 03:33:18,207
Well if it wasn't

1909
03:33:18,463 --> 03:33:20,767
Clearing out twice as much memory

1910
03:33:22,047 --> 03:33:23,327
Sex should be

1911
03:33:24,095 --> 03:33:26,399
Phasing out after 10 frames

1912
03:33:28,191 --> 03:33:31,775
Wonder why it's looking all wacky

1913
03:33:36,383 --> 03:33:37,919
That's a little bit too crazy

1914
03:33:38,175 --> 03:33:44,319
It keeps deleting because it had doesn't see it with him so you know what I think the problem is I think your accent

1915
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:50,719
Why not you're asking why your lighthouses are flipped

1916
03:33:50,975 --> 03:33:57,119
Do you think that I'm putting one in the wrong

1917
03:33:57,375 --> 03:34:03,007
Let me see you know it's possible

1918
03:34:09,151 --> 03:34:15,295
ARS

1919
03:34:15,551 --> 03:34:19,391
2 + 301

1920
03:34:25,279 --> 03:34:27,327
Anyway

1921
03:34:28,351 --> 03:34:29,631
R4l

1922
03:34:32,703 --> 03:34:36,543
I don't think it's going to look very good

1923
03:34:37,823 --> 03:34:43,967
That looks worse right I can't even look the same but because I think

1924
03:34:44,223 --> 03:34:46,527
By then

1925
03:34:48,063 --> 03:34:50,111
The back

1926
03:34:50,623 --> 03:34:56,767
Oh yeah I know it's crazy

1927
03:34:58,303 --> 03:34:59,071
Yeah I will

1928
03:35:00,095 --> 03:35:06,239
But what happens if you move it something's just hoseman what happens if you move it

1929
03:35:07,263 --> 03:35:08,799
To the right of the

1930
03:35:18,015 --> 03:35:24,159
Are you have to move your window more to the right

1931
03:35:24,415 --> 03:35:30,559
So office working up is kind of right but there's still a lot of arthritis wrong

1932
03:35:31,839 --> 03:35:37,471
Something just doesn't look right

1933
03:35:39,007 --> 03:35:40,799
Yeah I know something still wrong

1934
03:35:41,055 --> 03:35:43,359
Not sure what it is

1935
03:35:46,175 --> 03:35:48,735
Is rotations here

1936
03:35:50,271 --> 03:35:52,575
It's saying the rotation

1937
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:58,463
I should pronounce Lighthouse switch

1938
03:35:58,719 --> 03:36:03,071
Home

1939
03:36:03,327 --> 03:36:05,887
I have an idea for dinner idea

1940
03:36:06,143 --> 03:36:12,287
Pick a lighthouse tell me which what which light house to pick one

1941
03:36:18,431 --> 03:36:21,503
Can you see anything coming from the right Lighthouse now

1942
03:36:22,015 --> 03:36:24,831
I can see something from both

1943
03:36:25,599 --> 03:36:28,671
Well that's definitely wrong then

1944
03:36:34,815 --> 03:36:40,959
Oh I see what I can think of what happened now

1945
03:36:41,215 --> 03:36:47,359
Yeah so I'm not phasing it out properly I'm not phasing out the old

1946
03:36:47,615 --> 03:36:51,455
I need to phase out all four values

1947
03:37:00,927 --> 03:37:07,071
Dino technomark oh yeah the way we're doing this is this data

1948
03:37:10,399 --> 03:37:16,543
This data coming into this live survive contact is being sent to Dave

1949
03:37:16,799 --> 03:37:20,895
As well as to the screen and if you like it can be sent to you as well

1950
03:37:45,727 --> 03:37:49,311
You want to make it to A-1 as X and Y in the other is why the next

1951
03:37:50,079 --> 03:37:54,687
No I just need to phase out all four right but I'm saying you switch to your Acura indices

1952
03:37:56,991 --> 03:37:59,807
Change that back

1953
03:38:00,063 --> 03:38:04,159
You have sweet no stop stop look at that up there up there at the top

1954
03:38:05,183 --> 03:38:08,511
You go sweep Nam then none Suite

1955
03:38:11,839 --> 03:38:17,983
Oh yeah that that's what I was planning to

1956
03:38:19,007 --> 03:38:21,311
Did I do that the same

1957
03:38:28,735 --> 03:38:29,503
Wait a minute

1958
03:38:30,271 --> 03:38:31,807
That's the wrong one

1959
03:38:35,135 --> 03:38:35,903
That's right

1960
03:38:36,159 --> 03:38:38,463
Oh yeah sweet person numb right

1961
03:38:39,743 --> 03:38:41,791
Yeah

1962
03:38:42,303 --> 03:38:44,095
I mean look at how I'm using it

1963
03:38:45,119 --> 03:38:48,447
H&B angles are sweeping

1964
03:38:52,543 --> 03:38:54,591
I'm sorry guys you can't see that

1965
03:38:55,103 --> 03:38:56,127
There we go

1966
03:38:59,455 --> 03:39:00,735
Okay

1967
03:39:01,759 --> 03:39:07,903
So that could have been the problem also because that that could have easily caused the problem okay

1968
03:39:08,159 --> 03:39:11,487
But I already changed it to make it better when we finish

1969
03:39:14,559 --> 03:39:16,351
In fact yeah that is the

1970
03:39:18,143 --> 03:39:19,167
Is it no it's not

1971
03:39:19,679 --> 03:39:20,447
Maybe it is

1972
03:39:20,703 --> 03:39:21,215
Wolfie

1973
03:39:22,495 --> 03:39:28,639
But yeah that that that that's that's definitely that was definitely wrong with it was

1974
03:39:28,895 --> 03:39:31,967
Need to go up to where I initialized I need to clear it all out

1975
03:39:37,087 --> 03:39:39,647
If its Global variables that always start zero

1976
03:39:40,671 --> 03:39:41,695
Yes

1977
03:39:42,463 --> 03:39:42,975
Always

1978
03:39:49,119 --> 03:39:50,655
I don't believe you but

1979
03:39:51,167 --> 03:39:51,935
You know

1980
03:39:52,703 --> 03:39:53,471
Alright

1981
03:39:55,263 --> 03:39:57,311
I need to check Ollie's

1982
03:40:10,623 --> 03:40:13,183
That should fix it I'll give it a shot

1983
03:40:21,631 --> 03:40:27,775
Oh my gosh yes okay

1984
03:40:28,031 --> 03:40:34,175
But it is only works if it shows both if you could both White House with the same that is true but I'm okay with that

1985
03:40:34,431 --> 03:40:37,247
Persona floor

1986
03:40:37,759 --> 03:40:40,063
But is that lady that always coming over this way

1987
03:40:40,319 --> 03:40:44,927
Oh yeah okay over here let's see if we can get along here

1988
03:40:45,183 --> 03:40:50,047
There's gotta be a way I can make a quick change of the code

1989
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:51,327
I can get it

1990
03:40:51,583 --> 03:40:53,375
But it shows one of the other

1991
03:40:54,399 --> 03:40:58,751
Okay go for that

1992
03:40:59,007 --> 03:41:02,079
Just ask video

1993
03:41:02,335 --> 03:41:08,223
Uncommon all of the checks so uncommon all those if things if the the time than this

1994
03:41:08,735 --> 03:41:10,527
Justin commented trust me

1995
03:41:12,063 --> 03:41:13,343
This one

1996
03:41:14,367 --> 03:41:18,719
That I know I know I know

1997
03:41:28,959 --> 03:41:35,103
Okay it's definitely 90

1998
03:41:35,359 --> 03:41:41,503
Give me a call I'll move it move it more towards the Sun

1999
03:41:42,015 --> 03:41:45,343
Hey are you telling me to move it in frame

2000
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:46,367
Okay

2001
03:41:46,623 --> 03:41:52,767
Okay yes this is exactly right so if I hold it up here and I make it every point

2002
03:41:53,023 --> 03:41:53,535
Isabel

2003
03:41:53,791 --> 03:41:56,607
I can talking to buy

2004
03:41:57,119 --> 03:41:59,423
Thanks

2005
03:41:59,679 --> 03:42:01,215
This is perfect

2006
03:42:01,471 --> 03:42:03,775
This is perfect

2007
03:42:04,031 --> 03:42:07,359
Are you also going to call to tell me to move it in frame

2008
03:42:08,895 --> 03:42:15,039
Frame okay

2009
03:42:15,295 --> 03:42:21,439
Perfect is working okay there's still a lot of stuff you need to do

2010
03:42:21,695 --> 03:42:27,839
Spectacular

2011
03:42:28,095 --> 03:42:34,239
Oh yeah versus down here

2012
03:42:34,495 --> 03:42:40,639
Alldata

2013
03:42:47,295 --> 03:42:53,439
Oh okay thank you everybody for come

2014
03:42:53,695 --> 03:42:59,839
Coming out will be doing another stream tomorrow to hack multimeters

2015
03:43:00,095 --> 03:43:06,239
I hope you guys liked it

2016
03:43:06,495 --> 03:43:12,639
Oh great thank you everyone

2017
03:43:12,895 --> 03:43:19,039
Five minutes left of any any things they want to do

2018
03:43:19,295 --> 03:43:25,439
Actually I guess I should probably

2019
03:43:25,695 --> 03:43:31,839
Keep playing the song forexminute

2020
03:43:32,095 --> 03:43:38,239
We can do it now so

2021
03:43:38,495 --> 03:43:44,639
Look at it but they don't look glorious

2022
03:43:44,895 --> 03:43:51,039
Beautiful so wonderful

2023
03:43:51,295 --> 03:43:57,439
Okay

2024
03:43:57,695 --> 03:44:03,839
Hello

2025
03:44:04,095 --> 03:44:10,239
Playing with the code that you wrote is more fun than writing more code

2026
03:44:10,495 --> 03:44:16,639
And that's when your like maybe 6% finished with the game it's more fun

2027
03:44:16,895 --> 03:44:23,039
Play You're broken completely not ready yet thing

2028
03:44:23,295 --> 03:44:29,439
Then it is to write more okay with that being the case for right now and I'm okay with being 6%

2029
03:44:36,095 --> 03:44:42,239
Okay thank you everybody for coming out hopefully

2030
03:44:42,495 --> 03:44:48,639
At least a few guys tomorrow
