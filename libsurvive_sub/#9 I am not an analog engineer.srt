00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello everybody welcome and thank you for coming out to the 9th livestream here I just kept leaving

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,448
Lighting this after all this time

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Has been done by a wide variety of people people like E-Class her over

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,456
Discord have been trying out for 5

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
With different pieces of hardware such as the Raspberry Pi the odroid various internal cards in video

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,720
One of the things that even though we don't have anything right now to put me into

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
Codewise

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:37,376
We want to make sure that we're going to get this my charger as possible that can output to the HTC vive

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
Now you might say oh but why don't you do like a really powerful video card and the answer is flat out no

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:49,408
Alexa which isn't very much on my Intel card and so that's one thing I know can work

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
But right now trying to figure out is there any way to get the volume to work on a raspberry pies they're really really had survived to work

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
And all of this other stuff

13
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,672
Can so he's been doing a lot of work figuring that one out

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,048
Additionally mwtv I don't actually know what handily goes by

15
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
What is doing enormous amount of work with with having the the steam tractor and being able to get that

16
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
To the rest of the system but not done in wireless mode

17
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,968
Additionally live survive now has support for windows and OSX

18
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,320
Random Windows it's Portsmouth PC if you don't want install

19
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
Visual Studio

20
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Visual Studio both of the 4 driver registration models

21
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,376
Different drivers further 5 can be written and just use

22
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,520
Are without having to change any other codes you can just go Linkin and you driver and it just works

23
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
And yes no not 1080p definitely not actually streaming from my laptop

24
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
There I'll be off working on my computer

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
Quiet

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
That is because hopefully will get it least trying to print a circuit board and maybe seen what

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Turn alarm volume looks like I only have about 3 hours so it's going to be a bit of a stretch but I still

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
On

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Those with the steam cracker od2 Chapman has been working

30
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,248
Plus way I figure out a better way to do

31
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
David Japanese been working on a poser so the the lights

32
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Systems

33
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
The first are part of the system is where you take on data comes from device

34
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
On and these devices are called things like survive underscore

35
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
The source that we actually have and what it does is it collect

36
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Light pulses in imu information

37
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
And that into our survive data and survived

38
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,144
Guess these codes in handle lightcap

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,520
And another thing people have been working on newer disambiguated

40
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,872
Stop going back to that comes from devices

41
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Is Dan goes into something called a disambiguation

42
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Finger yourself please turn I saw this policy right old is Paul Stewart old is pulse hear what the angle of view is

43
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
From the Lighthouse then from there you can go into either the calibrator

44
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
The rest of the system still under process the data comes

45
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Ian from the Lighthouse

46
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Arm and then are we haven't actually coded yet but theoretically we were going to be able to use the base

47
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Do you know txt

48
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,552
Which I think is a pretty good idea what does

49
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
Can I have to trial and error 14 little bit further and once we can actually validate

50
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,791
So it will take the data that's coming in from the lighthouses

51
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
And then we'll see how does that producing good solution bad solution to good solution well

52
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
Then we have a pretty good idea that day what we're doing to handle the information from

53
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
The lighthouses is correct

54
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,319
Otherwise we'll just have to keep troubleshooting that

55
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
And then the data is passed off to on either

56
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
Will right now to cast off to posters and the calibrator

57
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
And we have poses

58
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,703
Such as ortho or poser troll slow

59
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,287
Are which candle are angle information

60
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
And then compute the the

61
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
The orientation and all of that all

62
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
An object based on it so one thing I can do right now is me

63
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
Reporter pipe

64
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Voice 05

65
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,655
IMessages Dave's mechanism forearm

66
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,239
Visualisation here

67
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Stop

68
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
Again

69
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
Try that again

70
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,999
Ok so here

71
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Is Dave's auto part trying to use a transformation

72
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,727
Figure out the pose of the bike headset

73
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
Until the red points are the points that were seen from the white house is point of view and the blue

74
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Lights are where we would think we should see those point if we are if we were to

75
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
His coding answered and it tells by the way

76
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
Is right here and it has this orientation and rotation and all of that

77
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,607
Is there still some bugs so it's still doesn't line up perfectly specially glancing angle

78
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Antonia prequels

79
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
Put ninja pretty good so I think is far as will really need

80
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Solution is almost there

81
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,503
Sets going to be really cool 1 seconds in a day

82
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,647
I am a hardworking guy and a microcontroller die

83
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:57,791
I'm going to finally this the first livestream I'm going to get a chance to do I want to do

84
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
I want to do is Bilton hardware

85
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Stop

86
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
Questions she just doesn't require calibration did work

87
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Does not require calibration data

88
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,247
The latest simply gives you right angles

89
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,391
After that you have to use the otx data which we are collecting from lighthouses and restoring

90
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,255
The we just don't necessarily know exactly what to do with it yet

91
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,655
Is it actually stores like the Earth cafes at khaltat kilkern atkal

92
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
Whatever all these aspects from the Lighthouse for storing we also don't have the posing

93
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,663
Station coming from the Post information that Davis provided

94
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Bye Dad just a matter of you know some of the people on the project getting together and figuring ok we got

95
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
I'm putting it in there so things are really

96
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Please

97
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Using

98
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,775
Probably not crisis still on

99
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
Yes it is possible

100
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
I didn't he knows which way round with her a p32

101
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,855
Anyway so

102
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,439
All the stuff is great everything's great

103
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
I think it's me and you you can totally just buy this chip from whatever it is something

104
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,959
Which will take in light data

105
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,543
And basically give you a on

106
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,687
How do you describe it it's it's basically leaving

107
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Arm steamship

108
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
5 shed

109
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Nope no no

110
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
Does anybody have what the chip is cos I actually like me cannot remember what the chip is that you can come

111
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Bye

112
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,615
But the problem is

113
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,247
Install paint

114
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,231
TS 3633 that sounds familiar

115
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,119
So digital converter for steamvr tracking

116
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,471
So this chick right here

117
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,871
So what does it takes in the infrared light with the bias and it

118
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,711
Reduces a in envelope output and on

119
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:11,583
Take a little bit install

120
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
Hi weed

121
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
No not gonna go

122
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,079
Are your part right now at least not until I give up

123
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Trying to do what I want to do

124
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
So what do you actually get coming from the the lighthouses

125
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
Something that looks

126
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
But it is a modulated signal so

127
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,511
You basically get this infrared coming from the Lighthouse

128
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,607
Arm and Wetherby sweeps

129
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,983
Already flash just have this modulated signal

130
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,127
And it's going to look something like not quite like that

131
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
And the reason behind that is because when you have an isolated signal you can use a high pass filter

132
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
And you can Dan only work for Life that's been transmitted about 1.8 m

133
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,215
Yeah that's cool by arm

134
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
What are really doing here is some some 30 electronics in order to take this

135
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199
Ignore right here and then I'm boosted up

136
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
And then what I'll do

137
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Is don't take this boosted signal

138
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,135
And I'll pipe it through a diode

139
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
Arm reality but like I dies is it means that you'll have the

140
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Here

141
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,399
And it will output kind of like this envelope

142
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Sing

143
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,799
And that the envelope shape depends on the

144
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
Where are these things start where they stop

145
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
On

146
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
And and you can pull a lot of information out of this and you can actually really get like the Pulse length and

147
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
Other information that's all past off

148
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
I'm in all this is actually done in an fpga inside of the series 5 controllers Wetherby

149
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,863
Controller or headset or whatever

150
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
And that's fine and dandy

151
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
But I think I can do better

152
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,871
Like I don't actually know if I can do better but it's one of those things like my mentality is like

153
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
I just always assume

154
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
I come to the table with different knowledge than anybody else the same as any of you guys watching words

155
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
You never assume that oh no somebody smarter than make him up but this I can't possibly contribute anything

156
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
What's the time in the final

157
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
Let's just check this

158
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
So instead of doing this I want to scrap this chip all together and

159
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
I want to try to do an Irish probably going to cost more in the end but considering

160
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,855
Kia d285 switch oral lichen esp8266

161
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
Built-in flash they are not even allowed to say how cheap they are there left

162
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
20 dollars and 10 cents

163
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
Firelight on that's the lowest I can tell you

164
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,775
The number for on and by the way if you want you can buy some new cd285u single chip

165
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
Like Wi-Fi solution for Wi-Fi but they're really cheap so what I am

166
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
To do is I want to have the signal right here

167
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,831
I want a pipe it into a high speed of

168
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,719
Arm course I'm gonna have a little bit filtering and stuff like that

169
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
Propaganda look more like this

170
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,191
Baby bath

171
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
What's going to happen is I won't be able to get the signal out and what I want to have is something that

172
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
Are fairly big signal here and I've known to use the Schmitt trigger on the import of

173
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
Esp8285

174
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,903
Rdi to

175
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,839
IPad and 12

176
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Hey do it's going to take in this wacky signal can it's going to digitise it into

177
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
A square wave for me

178
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:43,455
And the cool thing about the east pd25 is it's got in 18

179
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,807
Register on their soccer so I'm going to be able to sample

180
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
This incoming signal at 80 MHz Snapchats is or I'm not going to be able to keep up and processing

181
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,607
Navigate to drop back for tea I want to see what happens if I look at this input signal

182
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
I tried to figure out more information about what's going on

183
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
Maybe I'll be able to figure out orientation may be able to figure out much more accurately where are the

184
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,967
Now when the finger sweeping

185
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,623
It might be sweeping from here here and I like might be visible from there to there

186
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
The the wave started right there

187
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
Or maybe the wave started right there

188
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,631
Armin you haven't had her about 1.1 over 1.8 mHz

189
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Arm

190
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
So

191
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Yeah I know no fpgas

192
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,103
Esp8285 better fpga for what I'm trying to do

193
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:51,039
No way I can use an stm32 why use those commercially cos they're expensive

194
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
Also that ucd35 can totally go faster so I have absolutely no

195
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
Basically when when the sky came on the scene my interest in anything stm

196
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Went down the tubes

197
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
Especially esp32 I kicked the snot out of every single thing St has to offer

198
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Anyway so what I want to try to do is that I want to try to get

199
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
This this thing work

200
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,087
And I did what I want to digikey

201
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
I did find an interesting part

202
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,559
Actually I bought a home by 2 p.m. so I'm gonna try them out

203
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,215
Quite what I did find and what I did buy the sky

204
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,335
On it's really cheap it's 27 equality

205
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:51,199
And it's pretty good game out of fairly high frequency

206
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
Which is really useful to me

207
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,367
Armin so what I intend to do with the tray used this guy

208
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
And have it also

209
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
One problem with this

210
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:08,351
This part really requires a plasterer - + - 5 volt a swing

211
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,215
And I would be able to this I'm 3.7 V batteries

212
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,103
So one of the other technical hurdles will have is I'm going to have to have some sort of charge pump or something setup

213
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
In order to take the voltage of 3.7 volts or 3.3 volts I guess which is coming into

214
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
PSP

215
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
And take it up to something that

216
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
Well I can actually use

217
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Arm

218
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,719
And so and see if I can

219
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
Log in to

220
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
Set it

221
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
That's what it is

222
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Tell me move over here so I cannot

223
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Open church pump

224
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:17,215
So what I intend to do is have a circuit it's a little bit like this

225
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Only use to the gpio on the esp8285 or for this purpose

226
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
Esp8266

227
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,319
And I'm gonna go try to drive this charge pump so even though these only go up to

228
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
See what do I set up to

229
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
It's actually impossible I'm

230
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,583
Develop web pages like this

231
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Next step

232
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:53,823
Scroll to ml

233
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,223
Pause value 2.9 so the

234
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
The means with the voltage on

235
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,231
If I said a probe

236
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
So what I can do is by passing these on a graph those two things

237
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
I can actually get

238
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Are you cold

239
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
Run

240
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
Transit response let's go for it it's probably right

241
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
This is a negative

242
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
Send a site fine just to see you guys can see it even though all I have is easy

243
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
V or a 2.9 volt output

244
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Arm

245
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
This circuit can synthesise

246
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Oops

247
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
How do I zoom out

248
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,111
At the turkey can synthesise a -6 volt voltage

249
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,511
Arm so that it's going to be really useful in order to be able to use other types

250
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Of RPM spin don't do real the real

251
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
Don't know if it's gonna work out

252
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Meeting is if it does work out I'm going to be able to actually use this in other designs where I'm

253
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Have negative and positive for teachers

254
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
That m that I want to make

255
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,807
I can actually if this works I can feel radically dump the 9-volt battery and

256
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,927
Make the ESP synthesise the negative voltage required by the voltmeter

257
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
This is one of the two designs

258
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,703
The other design have to put some things around which I probably prototype

259
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,543
Before I am I go to back while

260
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Resistor DAC

261
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,759
I don't know what you're talking about ID

262
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Something something

263
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Anyway

264
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,488
So this is one part of the charge pump

265
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
We have to create another part of the charge pump

266
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,376
But I will have to

267
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Turn the tide out

268
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
So Steve as charge pump

269
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,200
Arm to the plus side of the charge pump that uses

270
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
Something that looks a little bit like that so instead of putting it up to the ground rail to the base

271
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
What we can men do as we can help hazard of real

272
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,280
Two are the basis and parks in words

273
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
You do that

274
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,984
Just do it's going to be none

275
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
3.3

276
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
Connections

277
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
Does not seem to do well with

278
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
On

279
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:31,168
I think all I have to do is put these around and it should

280
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,264
Produce a circuit that would do what I want

281
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
No

282
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,736
I usually don't actually do charge pumps normally what I do in more commercial things as I used a

283
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
An inductor in actually make like a switch mode power supply

284
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
But whatever I don't think I can get this to work really cheap with indoor

285
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Verso

286
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Tell me not gonna try

287
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
Thank you Mark I did not realise you were watching Mark

288
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
Mark we're going to have to have a heart-to-heart about life survive because I really think it's getting close to the point where

289
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Anyway

290
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,784
Can I give us a shout now on it

291
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
I've no idea if this works

292
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
I forgot to probe the output

293
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
Probes

294
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
Ok rhyme

295
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,336
Sweet looking at thing it's producing 9 volts ok

296
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,480
So this looks like it probably about what I want to actually use them

297
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
Nothing is here just guessing

298
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,672
Hi supersoaker oh my gosh everybody hello

299
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:03,072
So what I'm going to do is Amir take these two circuits anadrol mop in

300
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,216
I can hear the use gpio

301
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
13

302
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
14 for that

303
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,968
To do it that way am I going to do this

304
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
Maybe

305
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,976
Probably not to just operate the soccer

306
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Wouldn't be able to go all the way low

307
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
That's ok

308
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,640
Why bother doing something right when you can do something that might work

309
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
Even if it's really bad

310
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:58,880
So instead of having the negative side I'm only going to have a positive side for my charger

311
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,720
My somebody something is really wrong

312
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Thing

313
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,096
This is bad so let's just give it a shot

314
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
So gpio 12

315
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
That is actually the i2 Si

316
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,432
Armin that is specifically the pen that you can settle at 80 MHz on the S

317
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,760
Take me to 66 / esp8285

318
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,160
Gpio 13 and 14 are gonna be the ones that I'm going to go

319
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,744
Noodle around in order to make the charge pump work

320
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,120
All the breeding if you guys a curious on charge pump

321
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:45,472
Look up the Wikipedia page on it'll actually just give you an example circuit

322
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,312
Looks really similar to mine

323
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,872
And what you actually do they make it girl

324
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:59,296
I got it really does look so I got one last stage

325
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
Just a little bit lower

326
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
So we'll have to do is turn off in on 13:14 timing doesn't really matter I can just do it on

327
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Something like that finger up something eventually

328
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
Sofa right now let's go figure out how this is actually going to go be all wired up

329
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,712
So it's going to be there there there

330
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,040
So but I also have you

331
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,720
I bought some Diamonds to so I can just use those

332
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
This order

333
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Communion

334
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:01,248
I think for the first one I'm going to use this one

335
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
Spectacular

336
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:09,952
Madhouse um dia de Reyes date

337
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,768
Libraries

338
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,376
This is a new installation

339
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,240
And I don't remember had it in for you so I'm just going to go make my own

340
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,408
Say pirate on

341
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,440
Play It's A 223

342
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,192
And we're gonna go through some things in here

343
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,616
10 one is + 1

344
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
2

345
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
-

346
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
Two

347
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Riaz Common

348
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,464
Yes the circuitry will only be able to table data from one photodiode but it's so absurdly cheap

349
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,048
Why not there's another big benefit of this

350
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:56,448
I having only 14 processor it means that processor can then be used to process the data

351
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
From the photodiode

352
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
Snowfinders some sort of tourists I can use your magic can code

353
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,152
That would ordinarily be prohibitively difficult

354
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
I would have to spend time to go do it

355
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,784
If I code an object with 32 sensors

356
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,856
That has 32 esp8285

357
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,720
32 esp8285 is actually

358
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:24,608
3260 MHz processors for an effect of 5G

359
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Whatever it is

360
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,960
Drystone mate 5G

361
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:36,128
Skips skips whatever comes of processing power right there on the things that are able to pull

362
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
As long as I can do pretty quick

363
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
It's going to Green

364
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,320
Please find me a lot of extra computational power in addition all that

365
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
Maybe I could send higher level things such as running the disability later inside the sentence themselves and

366
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Only passing the angle that out

367
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
I'm so let's check this data here

368
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:02,240
Yes yes ba2570

369
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,592
Put it into a buffer for you and then call it sweet and done

370
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,344
123 ok

371
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,656
Stop the folder in half

372
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Wait a minute

373
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
Are you crack I did that wrong

374
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,368
32 x 160 is

375
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
No that's right

376
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
So I could run

377
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
Only two Solutions I could use for this one I could use the esp8285 at some stupid icespeed

378
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
300 something MHz and then use the ice Squirtle SLP and

379
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
Can you sing like a code division multiple access output stream which I will define and software

380
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:32,512
And then you can just use a little software-defined radio to receive all of the signals from all of the tax

381
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
That's one option but it does probably vileda lot of FCC rules I don't really want to do it

382
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
Do intend to use speedy 25 normal clocking Nutkins

383
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
52 Wi-Fi network but using related to 11 frames to send and then I can have multiple received

384
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
Intend to use diversity with this so I'll have 3 or 4 receivers so no matter what

385
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,512
Set signals going to get through some stupid hirade like send me to Magor

386
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:10,912
It's so it's going to use virtually no airtime so I should be able to slap in like hundreds

387
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
And it shouldn't be any any real issue

388
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,712
I don't think I don't think the esp8285

389
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
Going to be able to do Solutions but I could do is to say I can make it on there

390
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,512
Material pens my pens call go21 esp32 for specific device

391
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:42,912
Esp32 with the help of all those a speedy 25 is probably

392
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:49,312
I most certainly enough to do post solving in so much so love to do is Take That

393
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:55,712
And then have two more that Drive high-speed only displays I make my own

394
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:02,112
Whether or not I can do it

395
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
What's office thing one step at a time ok

396
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
Go now

397
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,312
It's not good what did I do wrong

398
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,712
Dad dad

399
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:34,112
Sorry news

400
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,512
Whatever you put in there

401
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
Everything in here

402
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:59,712
All I can do is I can use this allot 3.3 V thing there

403
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:06,112
And I can use to use a capacitor array

404
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
A10

405
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
This right here

406
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
Have one more of these every year

407
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
Please two guys together

408
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,912
So that looks an awful lot conveniently like

409
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:57,312
3.3 volts in

410
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:03,712
Soda b801

411
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
110

412
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,512
This would have to be crowned this is not

413
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:29,312
Whatever

414
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
Call 12 I'm going to have to figure out how to get blue slime

415
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:42,112
Install bind

416
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:48,512
Sierra people.at in chat

417
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
Yep definitely don't worry this is Kai god all the way

418
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
Dad

419
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,712
Developers do colicky kata something weird like that

420
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
It's also try to protect this

421
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
Drop him that RPM that I want to try so that's this one right here

422
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
Call somebody's tabs

423
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:46,112
Are the esp8285 does not have an appeal

424
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,512
Esp32 does have an fpo now much to my frustration cancel

425
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:58,912
People who make carrots actually cadence now who make the CORE for the esp32 the

426
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
The set itself is proprietary which I think is insane I email down there

427
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,712
I responded if anybody else has any contacts and salad or anywhere like that they might be able to get the instructions said that would

428
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:18,112
Buy however the esp32 through other means we

429
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:24,512
Has reciprocal filling point square root and other things like that

430
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
Will they can do these operations instantaneously like to Clark cycle do something to do reciprocal square root

431
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,312
Floating point so it's it's it's stuck behind

432
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
What is proprietary John like you not like you just can't get enough to date instruction set for the ESB

433
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
It's not a specialist fault it's specifically to intelligence fault and I think if they want to start

434
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
Probably sure they're gonna have to make their instructions set open like

435
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,912
Why is the secret

436
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
Anyway moving on let's go make a park for this other guy right here

437
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,712
Drawing Pirates

438
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
Yes I know I did not finish installing

439
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
New Cork in this part is called a

440
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
Mic90 y85

441
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
And your ears

442
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
1 +

443
00:39:54,368 --> 00:40:00,512
Two

444
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
3 - 3

445
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
4 is

446
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:26,112
5th class

447
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:32,512
Ok so that's kinda with that she look like

448
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,912
Let's go to draw a little part around it's two people actually be able to recognise it

449
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,712
1 unit

450
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:58,112
That goes there that makes it impossible to read ok fine

451
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:04,512
Long pin90 bus number 5

452
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:10,912
2 FM

453
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,912
Ok looks like a fairly reasonable Park

454
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:49,312
Background

455
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
Yz50

456
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:02,111
Mike 20

457
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:08,511
Ad part b head while

458
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
I know I did not like

459
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,311
20 wifey 5K what I'm going to do is dumb

460
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
Now I have in minus in in plus

461
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:34,111
I wanna play with them if I had to guess

462
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:40,511
Probably if somebody's are for it but I don't know if anybody in here is

463
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,911
I want to make sure I can actually

464
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Differential voltages at the rail

465
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
Can I use real the real pirates I don't even really know that I'm looking for here what I want to make sure there is that if I G

466
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:06,111
One of these two just ground that it won't freaking out of it might

467
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
But worried I forgotten what the type of thing is called though

468
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,911
See hear

469
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
Probably want to probably want a garden that I want to make a little bit safer

470
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:03,711
So what I'm actually going to do is enough with Ade

471
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:10,111
Find 1 of 1

472
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
Is wire for the rest of the stuff right now

473
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:35,711
I don't know what I'm going to do with the negative side there I got a figure that out

474
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:42,111
This is totally good for up to 12 V not actually 12 but it is going to be pretty good

475
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
And this is going to come from a connection

476
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,911
To do this

477
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
Radio

478
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
The Milky

479
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,511
Moving line

480
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
App iPad

481
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
See what is chat saying

482
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
2 lb 30 way too expensive I'm telling you use PE28

483
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
Are cheap wireless built-in

484
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
Just saying

485
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
Input common-mode range

486
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:24,511
Perfect that's what it's called voltage

487
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:37,311
They say a girl

488
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:43,711
From 0 of the Fall ok

489
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
Oh no 3.25 3.25

490
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:56,511
255

491
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:02,911
Ok so it looks like I will have to have at least like a Volta something V and a half

492
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:28,511
I actually need to do

493
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
Come on

494
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
Hi CAD

495
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
Ok whatever is now we have our library

496
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:58,111
So

497
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:04,511
I have a day out here going to ground

498
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:10,911
Going to be put friend

499
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:17,311
Then this one here I need a connector

500
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:23,711
102

501
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
2

502
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511
Adam is playing some video game I think the Witcher

503
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:42,911
Pharmacy here

504
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:49,311
You're biased

505
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:55,711
Is almost certainly going to need to have something

506
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:08,511
You might replace this with a

507
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:14,911
Initially

508
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,911
So what I have going on here is I'm making a time for makeshift high-pass filter but it's going to be an offer

509
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:53,311
Who knows maybe this will work maybe at the lot of things

510
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,711
Is aggressive is I want to try testing today considering only have 2 hours left out in half hour

511
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:06,111
Left on this lightstream makes me nervous but

512
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:12,511
Just give us a shot and see how bad is going to be are we going to be able to do this or any night

513
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,911
Play I am

514
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
Find parrot

515
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:44,511
Hold on I know you guys are actually telling me useful stuff

516
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,911
Alperton by the maximum output sink sink the short circuit

517
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:57,311
Not insured Circus that's good very high impedance output

518
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:16,511
I know all of these things should be fine on because what's going to have

519
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:22,911
I keep the sink locally and everything is going to be able to be kept in sync by the

520
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:29,311
By the White House itself so when it sends out of Flash I'm going to give it a watch that flash and singer

521
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:35,711
I do not still use

522
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:42,111
Papa it's just I don't know I feel dirty whenever I use it

523
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:48,511
I wish somebody like an open-source free version of it is just doesn't exist right now

524
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,911
It always changed

525
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:20,511
This close to here

526
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:26,911
All those look fine on what's using my

527
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,311
Ep 117

528
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,711
Yeah I switched my components mid way through and you just really shouldn't do that

529
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:11,711
I really don't like free router it's just not

530
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:18,111
It's it as much work to get things into and out of keypad but it doesn't even give you that

531
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:24,511
How much are they are like

532
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:30,911
I can rap better than all the time where is with Copa every now and total give me a run for my money

533
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:37,311
There'll be times from routed this perfectly and then Topaz like now I figured out his passed away

534
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:43,711
Oh you punk you are incredible

535
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
Now first of all would pick up some sot hello

536
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
Where is 23 SE12

537
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:02,911
Is that match up with the dealership here for that dice

538
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:09,311
Sea

539
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:15,711
3023 the wrong thing

540
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:22,111
I should have noticed because picture is different combination of four diodes

541
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:28,511
Play something

542
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:34,911
123

543
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:41,311
Bosch 23

544
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:54,111
Let's see here and see what

545
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:06,911
Yes

546
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:13,311
Really make that stuff visible

547
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:26,111
October is

548
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:32,511
Read up unbelievably good I just do not know how toper is as amazing as it is

549
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:38,911
Saying Toba can actually be me but like

550
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:45,311
Something like all teams

551
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:51,711
I know some people who tried to use the old pier Motorola in it

552
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:58,111
And basically all the commercial operators are just terrible but somehow tobi's is just

553
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
Believable and I can Crush any other routers

554
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:17,311
Read there's a lot of stuff

555
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:23,711
Slight redness

556
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:55,711
Stephen something

557
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:02,111
I'm mysterious what did Dave Jones

558
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:08,511
What is he come into with the the order Rattigan

559
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,911
Have you ever used it like I'm really serious what other people have to say about the altermodern

560
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:21,311
Because my parents have just been so hilarious

561
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:27,711
See her so this will go around that way

562
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:34,111
That is not

563
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:40,511
Comfortable living room

564
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
Hi Adam parking near the rooms playing video games with the noise

565
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:06,111
Try this calciferous

566
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,911
Do that

567
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:31,711
Too late

568
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:38,111
One of the ways a lot of people I work with you'll get around Altea

569
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
Eight layers why is needlessly

570
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,911
Do you sing by hand in 2K

571
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:57,311
Ladders

572
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:22,911
Really the only way back

573
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:01,311
Totally

574
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:07,711
You should be sad

575
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:14,111
Waiter

576
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,911
Big

577
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:11,711
That's entirely the wrong footprint let's just use it anyway spacing is right

578
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
Try this combination

579
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:50,111
These

580
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:09,311
Tackt-isle

581
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,711
Tile

582
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:22,111
By the way this is different from offer land

583
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:28,511
We tried with them

584
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:34,911
Stop the bags that Magnus badges and that was what messed up so I'm just gonna start using it now

585
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:41,311
Because I'm off to bed

586
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:47,711
What's good switches my summer in there

587
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:54,111
Something like that

588
01:03:54,367 --> 01:04:00,511
No reason for this be contact

589
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:45,311
Nonsense we don't need to get really

590
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,711
Design I think I'm going to go loose knob somebody's eye animals

591
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:58,111
1.12

592
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
People commenting about you

593
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
Richard yeah yeah by the way

594
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:55,711
Going to be much much lower latency than normal Wi-Fi

595
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:08,511
Connected through

596
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,911
You need to make light jumper there cos these are already connected like by metal inside the park

597
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:21,311
It's not like I sometimes words you actually have to my connected otherwise terrible things happen

598
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
Hi sweet

599
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:06,111
All this chocolate come from

600
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:12,511
Marshmallow

601
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:18,911
The Wonder Years

602
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:31,711
Flowers

603
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:38,111
And something something next thing we have to do we're going to have to

604
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:44,511
Tango to digikey and we will have to figure out exactly what part put princesses

605
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:50,911
Pretty sure it's not an sot23

606
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,311
I can just play

607
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:16,511
Halloween night

608
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,711
Violate the rules

609
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
Ok clearance 10 ml

610
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:48,511
Call Viola

611
01:08:55,167 --> 01:09:01,311
What's pretty crap

612
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
I didn't know that was he

613
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
Get there is a ton more like

614
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:39,711
Go design something in build something and have it working and it's still less than 5% of the way to

615
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:46,111
If you like 1%

616
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:52,511
Just because something works on the bench you are light years away from a function

617
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:58,911
Like I can go on the shelf product like

618
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:05,311
Polite neon FM arcade game that we made beautiful type done in like a month

619
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:11,711
We've been doing on it for 3 years

620
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
Remember what I'm doing

621
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,911
Yes done

622
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:37,311
Disguise

623
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:43,711
So let's find out what the parties

624
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:22,111
You'll probably have a third can which two more that has ground and on

625
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:28,511
The power as I can get to that probably going to be useful

626
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:26,111
I actually say that

627
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:32,511
EMC testing is complete

628
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:38,911
I am using Linux Mint

629
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:45,311
I'm good go

630
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:51,711
Plead yes done ok

631
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:58,111
Over here

632
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:04,511
Going to work

633
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
Don't know where they're going to go

634
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,711
That would work homeless up song

635
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:55,711
Definitely not

636
01:13:55,967 --> 01:14:02,111
Like a boss

637
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:08,511
Mrs probably tank a

638
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:21,311
Make a margarita

639
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:27,711
Weird anyway I do have a current

640
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:34,111
I don't have a current feedback loop but that's because

641
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:40,511
As the Frequency goes up the amplifier itself so ok this is a really

642
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:46,911
The interesting thing about engineering when it comes to these sorts of parts in general

643
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:53,311
Component a lot of engineers Put Em and a waterfall are really really unnecessary

644
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:59,711
SO41 if what you want to do is give us much pain as you want and have a lowpass thing down here

645
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
And you have as much as possible up here like a game you can just

646
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:12,511
No feedback basically and then it'll naturally take off the higher frequencies

647
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:18,911
Talking about I don't think City opened

648
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:25,311
At lower frequencies is going to be enough to mess with Adele

649
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:31,711
Roll a resistor in there just in case

650
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:38,111
Just in case I don't think I'm going to need it but

651
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:50,911
No say no population right now I don't think of

652
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:03,711
Yes I'm using exactly

653
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:10,111
You are correct that might not be sufficient that might not be the way to go I don't know

654
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,511
Really wanna over engineer if I don't have to

655
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,311
You like that

656
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:35,711
Here

657
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:33,311
Who's going to be hard the plan

658
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:39,711
Might not be able to do it this way

659
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:18,111
So close

660
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:24,511
Who actually

661
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:43,711
Ok we're getting there

662
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:50,111
Probably go like that like that

663
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:09,311
No

664
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:15,711
Heart

665
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:22,111
I'm going to just have to scrap

666
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:28,511
Really wanted to use that but I can't

667
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:34,911
I was trying to avoid using an extra capacitor by Frank use this year it's not make any sense

668
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:41,311
Play 11 like a third on that is not gonna be enough to get rid of all the nasties so I

669
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:47,711
Really do need to get my dad to capacitors out here

670
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:54,111
Hoop happy

671
01:19:54,367 --> 01:20:00,511
East to use a

672
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,311
Maybe in a 10 likes I can be enough

673
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:19,712
It's going to be rough

674
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:26,112
Really going to be rough

675
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:32,512
Really have another one yeah

676
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,912
That might be my sister hope for the best

677
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:45,312
Repercussions

678
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:51,712
I need to move some of the surround

679
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:34,112
Probably be on one you are so I have here

680
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:40,512
Trying to because I have a charge pump it's going to be super nasty

681
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:46,912
I don't have any 22 Mike 0051 ce20

682
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:53,312
You're probably right that would be that one

683
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:59,712
Don't have anything like that in any boxes already done

684
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:06,112
Turn my again turn my account

685
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:25,312
Set a router

686
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:31,712
Between there

687
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:16,512
I think this is all I need

688
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:22,912
I don't really use cutie and pretty much addicted to raw

689
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:35,712
13 silkscreen that's not needed

690
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:42,112
I will do though I will add AR

691
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:01,312
What you call this

692
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Crown plane ground plane

693
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:14,112
I wasn't quite far enough

694
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,512
Dispatches the 80 MB War

695
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:26,912
Make me sad poem

696
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
Write about

697
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:46,112
Ok well pass DLC

698
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:24,512
This is I'm trying to write

699
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:30,912
Design am like a test to see how hard it's going to be or if it can be fees

700
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:37,312
Alarm for me to read the five my house with really Ree

701
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:43,712
Cheap awful parts I just don't know if it's going to be feasible or white

702
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
I'm going to give it a shot

703
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:09,312
Yeah I know

704
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:22,112
Calcium plus looks like

705
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:28,512
All the big nasty areas are not covered with brown blinds just play

706
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:34,912
It doesn't mean

707
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:41,312
Speaking actor that's fine but a 10-mile that's 10 Mike

708
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:47,712
But somebody's are on here

709
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:10,912

Use these photo diode having be using them in the reverse on reverse bias mode

714
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:02,112
So we'll have to just cry going to be 10 and

715
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:08,512

01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:27,712
Volume one

717
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,912
So much is just guesswork

718
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:53,312
Don't know the electrical properties in so much of it it's just going to be

719
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:59,712
Myers bus

720
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:25,312

To see if I can actually get it to one layer without any jumpers at all I don't know if it's gonna work out

759
01:40:55,168 --> 01:41:01,312
I think it does

760
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:14,112

At once on regular paper to get it warmed up and then I print it twice

767
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,680
A hard time

768
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:42,080

02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:51,232
By the way that's all sodium carbonate so it doesn't really matter like when you do when you wash laundry with it

874
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:57,632
Goes down the drain anyway

875
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:59,424

02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:35,424
To a transparency list system one with I just use paper face down

886
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
That would be

887
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,752
Simple

888
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:12,544
