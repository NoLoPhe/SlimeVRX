00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
At full volume it's like

31
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
It's a bit much but it's what about you are you

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128

No although I do have a new esp8266 Gadget that I will be presenting later on

56
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
This coming week

57
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
Sex with an IMU and a bunch of other stuff all kind of crammed into it the biggest feature of it is that it has

58
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
Has a lithium ion battery charger like at the same time as having the circuit for USB so you can just like

59
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
Like plug it into micro USB while its operating and it charges its battery and then you unplug it and it keeps

60
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Working so have you got cursor is do you guys see my cursor today there is a cursor

69
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
Okay and keep that up

70
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,287

People

72
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
Yeah I would do after use a really low-res preview on my laptop otherwise just gets out of hand

73
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
What's a wemos I've never heard of that I've seen it on Twitter but I never

74
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Directly looked into what it was

75
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Good luck today

76
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,111
Hot sign is actually something that

77
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
We put together

78
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
Or aiyappa

79
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
That was Adam Charles

80
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
Did the wiring right and then

81
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Give me that in the shop super off

82
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:35,775
Yeah we for Unity if you guys know anybody who wants a sign like that it is Wi-Fi controllable

83
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,639
So I can take my cell phone here and connect up to it

84
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
Strong mode

85
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Take my cell phone and if I connect into it it automatically connect to my cell phone

86
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
As you can

87
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
You can't really see clearly yet it does have an esp8266 into in it which is I guess

88
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
What else would you expect

89
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
If I visit

90
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,519
192.1 58.4 .1

91
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359

00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,295
Floods that the little webpage for at the control so I can go under

94
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
LEDs

95
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,463
And you can see that it's showing via the effect that's going on right now

96
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
And Kane fused I don't really know how to pronounce his name but he

97
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,703
He put a lot of work into this to make me a really nice interface

98
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
So LED pattern to say it was 14 was the good one reason

99
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
And

100
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
So just by using the phone I can go click the button and it it changes the patterns

101
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,511
Thalia product if you guys want to get custom signs made we totally do it

It's black when I switch back to my my personal account

181
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
Sound on my laptop I do everything else from this account I think I'm actually doing this logging into a hardware terminal

182
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,063
Rpt terminal by definition of virtual terminal but

183
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
Weight GT terminal virtual terminal

184
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
It's like ATM machine okay

185
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Okay

186
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
I think it's time to get started

187
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
Okay everyone thanks for coming out to the 5th live stream now it's actually the third in the second row

188
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
Group or we try to find the locations of the lighthouses I think there may be some other ways to come about this but right now

189
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
Now I'm kind of heading down the whole find the lighthouses but before we even get there if there's just been a ton of problem

190
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,415
We've been running into just like one after another after another mostly due to the fact that I'm terrible of coding

191
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
Which makes me wonder what I'm good at but on any rate so we're going to have to today figure out

192
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:37,215
A little bit more about what's going on with the Watchmen a little bit more about how to do some of the disambiguation

193
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Of the light timing signals and I don't know maybe I'll be able to get a chance to show you guys a little bit more about what

194
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
What we talked about in the

195
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,783
If you know it that's a much better place to start let's actually start going through the issues right now

196
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
So some of the the issues by the way I encourage everybody to join along checkout a copy of

197
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,047
I've survived if you have I've fired up on your bike and if you have problems with that

198
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Patchett

199
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Do a push request and I'll handle it

200
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,007
That is if it works make sure your code Works before you do the pull request

201
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
So some of the things the one the issue from the last time determining the location of lighthouses is now up to

202
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,343
297 comments from just about everybody and this was from the

203
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,463
From the livestream event that we did two weeks ago at my parent's cabin

204
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,839
So punch people visualize where the points were realized we got the normals wrong

205
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
Amazing things happened where Ben was able to get HTC to send me my config file so I could

206
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Unbrick the the Vive

207
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
And we started to really dig in a bunch of different techniques were kind of brought up

208
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
Perspective npl like the PNP problems

209
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,623
And I don't remember the name posit I think it was positive

210
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Was that name of the technique I'm just various techniques 54 talked about to do what it seems like we're

211
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Trying to do

212
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
But one of the really big things is that the problem with the Vive is different from that

213
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
And Alan Yates the guy

214
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,127
I guess we should call him the Godfather of Lighthouse technology now

215
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
Actually buy the wave and if you can reply and chat and tell me if if if Yates is actually doctor Yeats

216
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:31,647
Somebody said dr. Yates and one of the things I'm really curious if I should be calling him dr. you

217
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
At any rate

218
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
They pointed out that

219
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,887
He pointed out that all of this mess that has to be done with like pasta and the PNP Pro

220
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,703
Problem missing I can find the opencv

221
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Epmp paper

222
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
I think this is it

223
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
No that's not it

224
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,807
I can't find it point is there's all these really complicated techniques to figure out where cameras are

225
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
Based on like three representations of the environment

226
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
And it's really complicated because of such a mess that there is with all the stuff

227
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Torsion and everything else that exists with cameras people try telling me that that's the future of VR and that's just

228
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Completely bogus because

229
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
It's just totally impossible to calibrate to anywhere close to the scale that Lighthouse thickness

230
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
Knology can be calibrated to a lot but for the most part I think that we're kind of shy

231
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Flying away from some of these already existing Solutions in really trying to forge forward with our own

232
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
For better for worse if you out there I'm talking to you anybody who knows how to coat it all one steak

233
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
The crack at this problem for this part of the problem I do have all of the other the files of

234
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
Available under common data for project

235
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,967
So if you want to go give something a shot and try to like pitch in and see if you can figure some of the stuff out

236
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,087
I do have a CSV that recorded from the the real systems

237
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
That's all right there

238
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,719
At any rate so determined location lighthouses

239
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
A ton of fun stuff

240
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Having hard time here

241
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,655
A bunch of fun stuff happened

242
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,287
PK tubes if I can find his post

243
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Oh

244
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,735
Something else we forgot about a half a day finally posted Allen yates's talk

245
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:39,135
I can't find it here where we relegates actually went into

246
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
By the way it's been responding chat been said you should totally call him.

247
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
And then someone else has responded that his Lincoln does not mention doctor so okay

248
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
You should call him dr. V K Tuesday no it's okay you stalked I renamed

249
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Altus dr. yang

250
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,623
So dr. Yates totally explained in his

251
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,743
And I wish I could little bit older for getting closing in on it

252
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
I totally went into a lot of details about the hardware and software problems that surrounded

253
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,543
The creation of the Vive and why it was not trivial which I would not expect it to me look stupid easy

254
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
But he points out that

255
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
I'm obviously not the smartest one in the room when he started busting out the whole point about the fluid dynamics linear

256
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
Something fluid dynamics something Motors

257
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,671
I'm like okay got it this is way outside or something I'm going to be doing in my basement

258
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,607
Any rate if you guys do want to go see a really awesome talk about how the lighthouses work

259
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,423
Totally check out the hack of the article

260
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,775
You know what I think I might just post this in the

261
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
In the

262
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
The read me here

263
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,159
Extra resources pack-a-day article

264
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
Article and video with doctor

265
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,448
On how they made the Vive a thing

266
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Okay

267
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,640
Moving on

268
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
One thing we had a note on his but I do need to do more get pushing and I'm going to really

269
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
Make an effort for that this time and I will also paste this into the chat

270
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,520
Hey Charles just try the opencv algorithms I found out today was very noisy with some light filtering I was able to get

271
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,896
I was fairly precisely Octavio if you want and you're up for it

272
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
Please please pinch in here start trying to pitch in

273
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
Specifically finding the lighthouses we can get away with something other than the MIT license

274
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
For what Mayan gold needs to be though I would really like it if we could just keep everything seed and

275
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,728
Everything minimal requirements I know what the opencv stuff you kind of have to pull in opencv

276
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,568
And that's that's kind of a big deal

277
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
So going back to all of this

278
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
So Alan needs kind of hopped in and he pointed out that the the volumetric plots that we were plotting out

279
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,720
Last time didn't really make a lot of sense to him as to why

280
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
Why the data would look the way it did and I totally get that but I think that to me

281
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,704
It made a lot of sense because any of

282
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,312
Well we'll go into Howell my Approach is working soon but he pointed out there was a little bit strange

283
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,920
That's one of the things are going to try today is to try to view that data in a different way

284
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,784
Or or analyzed in a different way that might be a little bit friendlier to finding the centroid be

285
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,136
The most likely location of the lighthouse

286
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Okay

287
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
I think anything else

288
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,632
Just that right now my plan forward is by

289
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
I'm going to we got to go figure out what's going on with the exact pulses and why some of the stuff isn't lining up the way I thought

290
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,152
I think some of it has to do with the disambiguating being rough

291
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
My disintegrator is not very good so if you think you can figure out a disambiguation the signals the pulse

292
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,648
Houses of light and what they mean better than I can which you probably can

293
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
I go in there give that a shot

294
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,792
I have an example of some of the code that I did use

295
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,912
It's a little different now but it's almost the same if you look in the GitHub repo

296
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,984
And I collected a bunch of data and we uncovered a bug

297
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,848
One so far which I'm sure there's more with the Bendy coding

298
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
So that was that was kind of fun

299
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,856
Pepsi I'm just kind of rambling right now this is there any direction anybody in chat has your questions

300
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,256
Different couple like basic questions they've been trying to summarize like just

301
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,144
What's going on here about like trying to reverse engineer with the Bibleman case

302
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
Okay I don't think I want to spend five minutes explaining how the vibe works

303
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,200
In this this this life has to have done that about every other time

304
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,528
I'm sorry I'm going to avoid that this time

305
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,160
So I do appreciate that you guys are kind of chatting back and forth in chat so we can keep things rolling

306
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,232
Figure it out for themselves

307
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,584
It's probably best to do the first video

308
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
I like the summer video Summer video yes I am going to try to get a thumri video edited but I

309
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,384
I unfortunately do have another closet commercial esp8266 project I need to go make a video for and

310
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
I need to get out the door like ASAP because parts are literally just waiting to go out the

311
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,720
Need to make the video I am sure it later on the broadcast I'll explain that to which at the time

312
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,608
I was not thinking about the buy but now that they might be able to work together

313
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,264
I'm trying to think of anything else that really happened that was that cool I mean just the really The Big Three

314
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Freebasic

315
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
Three basic bugs the first fog being check

316
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,904
Been coding to the bank holding is still something's not right with it in my code I'm not interpreting

317
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
Something correctly I don't know what it is but we're probably going to have to go scope that out some

318
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
That that can be done kind of in parallel with this other stuff

319
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:19,008
One of the other things has to do with improving

320
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
The disc

321
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
And big you a tour and that's the thing that can kind of tell me based on these flashes of light

322
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,040
Where is this photo diode based on this lighthouses sweeps

323
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:37,440
That's going to have to invite where it is I don't mean where it is I mean where it is and 2ds face

324
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,840
So like if I were to shoot a real from the lighthouse where would that go through what point would that go through

325
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,192
That's that's what they needed for and finally

326
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
Really doing one or two things one finding Lighthouse positions

327
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,456
Or finding another way altogether

328
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
Or something because what we need for face 3 so we're still in phase two of this project which is annoying

329
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,512
I thought we would move in but it's harder than I thought just like everything else I've ever tried it

330
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,328
It's just always more difficult than I could hope

331
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,400
Phase two is where we

332
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
Find the lighthouses

333
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
Phase three is where we can track a point and a

334
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Hose

335
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
And phase four is where we used and

336
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:40,928
And if you guys have been paying attention to the GitHub things I am really tempted to just Jo

337
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Jump straight there

338
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:49,632
So I have actually done a fair bit of computer vision stuff before this is a picture from a project from a

339
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
While ago where I was just tracking using cameras really really inexpensive planners

340
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
Oh got it

341
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,944
Can you say something so I can get your name to moderate

342
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,832
Can't do anything either

343
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Say something in chat and I'll mod you

344
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
To him

345
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Set user as moderator

346
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
So it's not that I haven't ever done any kind of tracking systems before and I

347
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
I have dealt with them

348
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
I've dealt with commercial ones and I've kind of rolled my own never had to do anything really precise though

349
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,832
Except for my thesis had to be really precise but that was a different problem altogether so it was much easier to

350
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
Much easier to accomplish like

351
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,024
Mm level tracking but it was totally different solution very easy to do

352
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,120
But I know like I'm toying with just creating a pose

353
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Like a

354
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
What are those things called where you have like

355
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
Seasoning stainless Center

356
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,408
Nothing that has the x y and z

357
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,248
Oh

358
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:14,880
Display the actors I don't know

359
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,952
But it's like being the physical

360
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:25,120
Whatever it is

361
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
One request from the chat

362
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
New I have the chat window on the sides they can see it cuz it doesn't get archived with the screen

363
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh okay

364
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
Oh I know I do know they want to make it to it that anybody who's watching it later can watch the

365
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:49,952
I will said it's always on top okay and I will scale this so that that work

366
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
Okay

367
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,800
Frame that's the right word I'm just toying with

368
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
Using a coordinate frame in 3D space

369
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
Plopping it on the floor in the middle having one meter between each one of the stupid accies and then having the light

370
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,416
Lighthouses figure out where those are and then we can just straight-up resolve position

371
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
Define their universe

372
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
I'm 20 with it

373
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
But

374
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,840
Not necessarily

375
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
Going to happen

376
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,496
After all it is kind of skipping phases

377
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,896
Phases two and three all together kind of use for to go back to and I have no

378
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:46,528
No idea how hard it's going to be to use the esp8266 as a detector in this sort of situation

379
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,904
So I really kind of want to go through in order but maybe maybe not

380
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,256
Anything else that came up in chat that I should be addressing right now

381
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,704
Okay so going forward some of my plans on this one

382
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
So from last time

383
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Fossil Pathak

384
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
If I was using voxel tastic to go visualize some

385
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
Some 3D models of how would it look like the the lighthouse data

386
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
Who let the knotwork rgba pretty

387
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,240
232

388
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,568
54

389
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:48,480
Yeah there we go

390
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,088
Plastic tube you what the

391
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
Have you what the the shells look like what the

392
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
The shells are the likelihood of a lighthouse seen any one of these

393
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Locations

394
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,912
And as you can see that it's it was a little bit rough

395
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
So

396
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,080
Didn't really work that well

397
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
I did try though and we're still going to keep going right now this is being viewed

398
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
And kind of Cartesian space

399
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
And I want to try to move it into Polar space and I think it's going to like really kind of bound itself into a centroidal

400
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
A lot better that way

401
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,304
One of the other things to note is that Alan Yates was a little bit

402
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,656
Concerned over the fact these look like shells rather than kind of blobs

403
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,520
So I don't really know what to make of that right now but we're totally going to look into that

404
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
So we can totally just visualize the different possibilities of

405
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Lighthouse not that

406
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,624
Totally pie visualizing different possibilities

407
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:04,512
Like this is I guess the our Lighthouse where it's like Yeah The Lighthouse is totally in there

408
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,936
Locations jeopardized by the rotated wattles

409
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,568
Steve Hamilton normals before doing that

410
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
Doing what the visualization

411
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,040
Remember you were having an issue with the headset normal seeing tilted in

412
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:32,672
I don't remember that I know that I know that there was a problem somebody had with it but then

413
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,048
I don't believe there's any problem now did we check that before we did the beta

414
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
Hope it in ya The Laurels weren't actually facing outward

415
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Play should be there all

416
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
Focus play straight down

417
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,128
What's what's the normal time the headset itself at War

418
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Oh

419
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
I don't think so

420
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,880
Let me check the one guy did do the open scad thing

421
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,488
So those normals are all Hokie

422
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
Those are all Hokie

423
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't know what's going on there

424
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,704
I don't know this person visualized the normals and open scad and it looks just fine

425
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,616
Mary Hackman everyone

426
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Anyway

427
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
Yeah that one down the bottom

428
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
Yeah it does look correct so

429
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,472
Put in timeout how good

430
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,384
Anyway moving on Soviet visualization is kind of a point Cloud saying these are all of the possible places

431
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Could be

432
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,224
How likely it is it is it any of them

433
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,880
I can make it so it visualization sold more so you can see that for at least some amounts of data

434
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
It converges really nicely like

435
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,840
You know the head like houses got to be in there so some of the things I wanted to do

436
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
Was I wanted to use the normals of which way it's pointed toe

437
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:36,576
I will not touch the significant now so each one of these sensors

438
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,976
Tear on the headset it has a normal associated with it I was my first look at them like

439
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,816
World they do that

440
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,960
I always I I never go into a situation assuming that I'm

441
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,592
The dumbest person in in the room but I will always be quick to realize that

442
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
As best as I can

443
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,296
But Eric was looking at like why would they put normals in with this data that seems completely used

444
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,648
I'm already using

445
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,256
So because there's a normal associated with this it tells you which way is pointed

446
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,352
So all the sudden there's a lighthouse up there behind the camera

447
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
And if I hold it like this then

448
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah that that sensor can totally see that Lighthouse but if I hold it like that and it's pointed at that Lighthouse over there

449
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
See it so really quick we can just immediately cut out that is a possibility of where those this lighthouses

450
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,856
Because this photo sensor here is getting data from it so you can do real quick

451
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
How to cut out

452
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,768
For one of the other things that I doctor Yeats has pointed out through a lot of this is that

453
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,608
The normal itself and the the the angle

454
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
And the distance from the lighthouse

455
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
Will control the length of the pulse now I'm hoping we collect some data on that this time

456
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,224
To try to get an idea as to how much the distance affects the Paul and how much the orientation affect the pulse

457
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
But I'm thinking we can use that

458
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,440
To help narrow down the picture so though the date of might look like this right now

459
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,280
Or I mean I gots a little bit worse if you look at the other one must look at

460
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
Our lighthouse

461
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,568
You look at this man it just does not know where that other lighthouses

462
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
I'm thinking that by using the normal data and having it like the rotation control that way you can do a

463
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,368
Much better job it kind of narrowing this down I don't know that that's true but I think that's true

464
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768
The the other thing I wanted to try was to put the Watchmen controllers farther out

465
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:58,656
I still have this sitting in the center of the room 15 the coordinates frame and having to watch them controllers

466
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:05,056
Having Watchman controllers on the floor on either side and using them to

467
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,456
Kind of determine like okay it's not possible for this Lighthouse to be here and then this one to be here

468
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:16,064
Because if this was the case then the geometry for the the

469
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
The angles for where the the Watchmen are wouldn't lineup

470
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,304
And to be able to rule out that early come up with the score of How likely or unlikely

471
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,632
That we have the position and composed of a

472
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,448
A specific Lighthouse correct

473
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:38,336
Spell make it really easy to just kind of start ruling things out and hopefully narrow down where the lighthouses are

474
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,992
See how that goes and I did mention in the the issue that I am toying with just giving

475
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Straight to phase 4

476
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Not doing yet

477
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,928
Think that's it for the summary

478
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,840
I can't really think of anything else really happened over the last week that's

479
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
It's that big

480
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,032
The other than dr. Yates posting some cryptic things to Twitter

481
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
I'll see if I can find one of them

482
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,112
Calendar dr. I can't remember that time doctor

483
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,184
I posted a really neat picture here of

484
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,584
What happens to the region of convergence for the 2D Lighthouse problem as you rotate the initial speed

485
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
Depose

486
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,656
Through a full-term

487
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm guessing that means that when you're just making a rough guess in the dark is to what

488
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
Where the lighthouse my

489
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,504
What is what happens over time as you move that potential pose I don't know for sure

490
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:56,928
I don't know there's a lot of nomenclature that because I'm so new to this I have no idea how to even barely speak

491
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
The same language is

492
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,000
Is

493
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:05,376
Fannin dr. Yates because so many times like they here's what you do

494
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,776
And I have to go spend the next like four hours figuring out how to actually do the thing they just completely gave

495
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
Give me the answer for

496
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
Orientation LightScribe

497
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
I believe

498
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
Who's Ruby orientation and position

499
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Location I can believe that

500
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
I'm not imagine for this for this image yes that's just

501
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
From Unity

502
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Okay

503
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
But then why would it be the initial seed pose unless he's referring to like Hammer here object here

504
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
Lighthouses guesses hear lighthouses get to your Lighthouse to get to your lighthouses yesterday

505
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
They don't

506
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
I have to figure out where they are

507
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
I think what he's saying is

508
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,656
If you have Lighthouse tile and you take that

509
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,240
And then you slowly rotated throw-in combine the data

510
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
Change the gas like that

511
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,736
But rotating around what like rotating around the point man gets around itself

512
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,320
Location Point rotational irritating it

513
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,744
But would it be the the the lighthouse rotating or would-be the lighthouse rotating in 3D space around the corner

514
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
Well this is just a stimulated

515
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Problem I think

516
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
Well you could ask yeah

517
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,967
Dr. Yates

518
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:01,343
Too late you already know your secret

519
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,975
Oh by the way if you are curious the reason I was thinking doctor Yeats was

520
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,327
I first saw that was

521
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,007
Yeah right here I was somebody who is not named

522
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
I mentioned

523
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:26,175
I see doctor Yeats has already responded to more intelligent posting to threaten us like dr.yeh

524
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:40,511
Dr. Gates entity color is the number of the aeration totopos Verge 21

525
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,607
Um position urad wrote a orientation

526
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,935
Wait one micrometer micro rod

527
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,007
That would appear to be the case

528
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
Is that using fake ideal date or is that using real like did you actually capture some data cuz

529
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,503
There is no way I'm getting any of my data to converge to Within

530
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,879
Purple is where one micrometer singular

531
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Singular

532
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
Yeah

533
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
Oh no

534
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
Photomath

535
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:26,079
I heard jacobia before so you're actually somehow I don't know what the problem would look like

536
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,407
Matrix problem that can just convert

537
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,271
I would be me to send me I just looping through a raise and just hoping for the best

538
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
Yeah I did see a doctor Gates's hackaday presentation video in fact

539
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,095
With all of the hacker. Hack a day

540
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:53,727
But just sounds funny when I say all of the hack of anyway all of the hackaday

541
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
Presentations from the hackaday superconference like even hoses there for one of them that I should have just

542
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
Gone like that would have been so worth it

543
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,503
Just to mean any one of those talks now

544
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:12,159
I would have been there I would have known

545
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:17,023
The month sound I when was the Super conference obey weeks before I knew about it

546
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:23,423
Cuz it is a little bit sad that I did not even find out that this Lighthouse system existed it all in

547
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Until like

548
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
The week before Thanksgiving

549
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
400 * 1

550
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:36,735
23 is a lot different than 400 times and p array

551
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,039
Oh are you making fun of the fact that

552
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
That my

553
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
Okay you guys are starting to I know you guys know what you're talkin about to each other

554
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
But I think there's some information

555
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,215
Not

556
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,823
Oh no

557
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
MPI mean unless you're making a joke at me about my Approach being

558
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,295
On polynomial but it is by definition

559
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,439
Polynomial right like oh van to the 6th which is how terrible my algorithm is it still polynomial

560
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,303
That was my own python bug

561
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,655
400 000

562
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
100 * 1231 copies of 123 but I don't understand what that has to do with

563
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Okay

564
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,503
Got it I'm as you can tell I'm not a python guy

565
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,599
You want me to go right this out will that

566
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,415
Well that's a laptop dying

567
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,023
Closing that closing that okay

568
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
What did you do to it

569
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,679
It's just so slow it's just that flow

570
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,591
Come on come on okay

571
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
Is a lot different than

572
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
I must see what this looks like

573
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,831
Injecting says he's solving future Lee health problems while you're solving salt float

574
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,047
Where did he say that

575
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
Absolutely earlier it's going to be 10 Jackson is solving future lighthouse

576
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,847
Problems while I'm solving solve Lighthouse problem yeah I totally believe you

577
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
But it's someday someday I'm going to be solving Lighthouse problems that will

578
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,807
Will never be your Lighthouse problems

579
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:53,951
In fact they will be Lighthouse problems I will create entirely of my own accord

580
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
Like the third

581
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:07,007
Why why do they exist says that

582
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,847
Operation not a scalar multiplication

583
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
Oh that's cool so it's like almost like

584
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
Finken convolution

585
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:31,071
Would make 400 400 123

586
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
Tannerite x 400 but I regret that I don't understand what that has to do with anything we've been talking about

587
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
Unless that has directly to do with the picture you posted to

588
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
Anyting

589
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:56,671
Okay

590
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
Laptop is

591
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
Cuz this is like I think it was

592
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
The first

593
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
I5 of the type but it's a 2450m which is

594
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
Like I guess a little bit faster than a quarter to Duo but it's absolutely

595
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,551
Cuz the laptop itself is like

596
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Tony

597
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,951
Nope.

598
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
Okay

599
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,751
I also feel a little embarrassed I can't even figure out how to like

600
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
Make

601
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
No I don't have them hot

602
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
What

603
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,671
ShopRite of Ono

604
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,471
Oh wow okay just turned away out

605
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
Okay

606
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
Looking like a lot of background fresh yeah I know it's coming through

607
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,071
Normal microphone a little annoying

608
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:58,271
Let's hope that I can

609
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:04,671
What's the okay is the sound back to normal now can you guys hear clearly

610
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
The answer is don't put the laptop over while the webcam is plugged in because

611
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
Laptop also has terrible

612
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,871
So

613
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:30,271
It's really loud. High game

614
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
Well no cuz that's going to sound all crunchy

615
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:43,071
Okay hold on

616
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:49,471
Can you guys good now

617
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:55,871
Good now it's odd that doesn't

618
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:02,271
I hope I won't need to reboot

619
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,671
Stream to get that to work

620
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
What about if I just leave the volume down is this is this microphone good for everyone or

621
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:21,471
Balada background humming system humming okay got it so we really have to figure that one out

622
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:34,271
Timolol do I will just pause and restart

623
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:40,671
Laptops on board Mike I am but now I'm trying to push away from it okay can you guys hear me clearly

624
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,231
Really now does that work

625
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:48,351
Oh you got it okay if that's the answer whenever that happens I felt so good Lord

626
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:54,751
Oh my gosh so many messages

627
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:59,103
Okay

628
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,967
Song

629
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
Backcountry

630
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:29,567
All in an effort to just click on copy and paste this one thing

631
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:42,367
Oh you're saying that's a lot different then that no

632
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:48,767
Steve values Racine position or something that was for the

633
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:55,167
Dr Yeates Twitter video Twitter picture

634
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
No I don't think so region of Yeti solver convert

635
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:07,967
Initial seed pose through full-time

636
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,695
Yeah sorry this definitely works better with simple screen recorder OBS definitely when I

637
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:24,095
Never I have Adam's laptop and Olivia anyway I don't actually have a released

638
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:29,983
I would plan for today other than I was going to collect some data

639
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:38,175
I think he's had enough of the doctor Yeats is no academic credentials Beyond ice cream

640
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,087
Summit research

641
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,183
I'm clearly not a real witch doctor

642
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:55,583
Dr Yeats what is your title if valve or your position

643
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
Never really asked

644
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
We don't have pedals are positions that tell

645
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,415
Very

646
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:27,327
Abnormal culture as far as companies go there if you're hired

647
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
You're basically on the same one

648
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
That's a little crazy

649
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
It is very unusual

650
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
That is crazy

651
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
Basically there are no bosses or

652
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
I guess the only person who would have

653
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,711
A little more weight pull would probably be given

654
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:49,855
Okay but yes there's no official losses

655
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,903
I'm still pretty sure

656
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Keith

657
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,863
Just released Kawasaki cardiologist neurologist like phrenology like brain phrenology

658
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
Okay let's see

659
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,823
Lucky Lighthouse virologist

660
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Is that

661
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:25,439
But actually what that mean

662
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,007
Neurologist video cut out for me

663
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
I know why

664
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:47,967
Okay just came back hold on let me Jack in myself moving now

665
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,439
Okay and hopefully it will connect in

666
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Streaming on Wifi bad

667
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,583
Yes okay now we're actually streaming on regular so good to go

668
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,423
I think we have

669
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,775
Stalled enough here

670
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,103
Coco somebody

671
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,663
And let's make sure that

672
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:21,247
Some of this data will actually work

673
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:27,135
Actually I need to make a new issue

674
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
Daytona recorder

675
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,703
I know it make clean all cuz I know I've done a lot of stuff that could break that

676
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
Guitar tuning

677
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,591
Right now

678
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,991
Work the first time tracking tracking but collecting date

679
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Data from the

680
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,343
This thing

681
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:03,231
Timer

682
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,351
But I didn't move

683
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
Sudo get install coffee

684
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
Yes

685
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:20,639
I could go for some right now it is 11

686
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:27,039
Oh I'm sorry Mindy

687
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
I got a song but like

688
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,159
I thought for 5 hours after work

689
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
That's weird

690
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,791
What's weird

691
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:43,679
There's like one pose I can get it in where we just say it's freaking out sometimes

692
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:50,079
Oh I am too close. Yeah I think I am

693
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:56,479
I actually to close is that

694
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,879
Use the venerable Ben

695
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:09,279
What is your title

696
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,679
We have dr yates and the problem is that prevents

697
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:22,079
Terrible prevents me from getting too close to Lighthouse

698
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,663
Cuz the regular actual data pulses that sweet

699
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:32,063
Are so long when you get that close to the lighthouse because as the date of sweeping over

700
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,463
I just take so long to go poop that I'm entering the pulses is those

701
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,279
They were actually coming from a lighthouse itself

702
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,583
So that's why if I get this

703
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:51,263
Papa. Bear

704
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,567
So we have the lighthouse up there

705
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,663
And then I'm going to go sweet this down to me

706
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,455
Sony here

707
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:04,063
Lighthouse up there be here lighthouses there

708
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,463
Okay

709
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,863
So you'll see that these numbers right here

710
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,263
The column right here so if it's far away that they're relatively small

711
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:36,063
Scrap for

712
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:42,463
Can you turn around and face this one and make sure the other one can't see it

713
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,863
Towing

714
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,263
Gay an alpha around the other way

715
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,663
Why is that not a quarter

716
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:08,063
Is what we're doing right now

717
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,463
How in the world am I ever going to do this in like 5 hours a week. Where you want me to

718
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,863
Oh that's a good point indeed have to do this from scratch

719
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,495
Something's freaking it out right now I don't know what that is

720
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:32,895
Ben is the best guy and after Gates of heartbreak I

721
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,455
What doesn't make any sense the hell I've received it

722
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:40,575
Figure it out I'm sorry right now Chief virologist Gates

723
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:48,767
Right but why is it freaking out and of course then says he's a terrible math guy

724
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:55,679
So I know math people but they've never been able to can like convey to me

725
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:02,079
In a way that I can have some time but it's very rare that they can convey Matthew things in a way that I can understand

726
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:09,247
So very often I just end up doing terrible things to get by I'm curious if that's similar

727
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
Bodenheimer asks how important are the flashes are we using them

728
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
Location in this instance

729
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:29,215
In order for us to figure out where to plot the points on the screen which not doing too hot with right

730
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,031
Right now

731
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:38,431
Don't know why in order to do that on the screen here for the

732
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,575
Not working but

733
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,207
I'll make it work but most the time

734
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,607
What I do is I time the difference between the flash of light and what time they get swept so as I move

735
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,887
This way in this way

736
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:04,287
You can see it moving up and down a fair bit also it is I have never

737
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,175
Never seen it this glitchy me see if I'm just doing something terrible

738
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:16,831
Jittery hard to say buy a book computational forum

739
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,135
Optic

740
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:27,839
Am I doing

741
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,911
My wife

742
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,479
How to take care of I'm not doing something dumb lately divorce Eightfold attend at you later

743
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:50,879
No I need her first of all that is what the other guy I can remember his name right now while he's working

744
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:57,279
And it looks promising to me but I have a difficult time really understanding is Kobe

745
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:03,679
One comment in the entire thing one

746
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:11,359
Jay pichete I know his real name

747
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:15,711

748
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:22,111
Disintegrator Dusty Julian picked picked

749
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
I can't pronounce his real name cuz I don't know it

750
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
Yeah

751
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,303
Haven't give up at 4 a.m. Optik problem solution to our current problem

752
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,935
Okay yes possible

753
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,519
Phrenologist phonology

754
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,055
What was the word again

755
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
Virologist virologist

756
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:57,439
But I guess something's going on and no I'm not stepping on my own memory something's just busted

757
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:01,023
Boston

758
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,263
Wicked

759
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,135
Come on

760
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,207
Factory Card outlet even still freaking out

761
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
That was pretty freaking out

762
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:44,031
I'm sure

763
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,079
What is going on here

764
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,903
Mustafa's more busted than I realized

765
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,255
Right now we're not actually using

766
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,351
Julian new

767
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:13,471
Disambiguation her I'd love to use but if I can find the comment

768
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,079
Here, just maxed allowed gift for a match

769
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:24,479
Okay I guess I can understand what that means

770
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,295
Simply complicated

771
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:33,695
Be here so why is this doing that

772
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
Beta

773
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:43,423
Go on the things I've been doing a pair of it is printing out date at the distant the UA doorstep to try to understand least what in the world is going

774
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,471
Sort of what's going on

775
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:49,055
Hold this up until it disappears

776
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:53,407
Close it out see why in the world that disappear

777
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,647
Okay to talk about right now

778
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,255
I see here it's really simplified as though

779
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,583
We should probably switch mode a

780
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,799
Something something cooler Edge Phillips

781
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:29,247
Yeah you're right they are JK Oxys I really should Define it that way I like that you guys

782
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:34,623
Did they saying K instead of X and Y that way it really helped like prevent them of the confusion

783
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
Do you like where you're going with the polar coordinate system

784
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,815
What

785
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,911
Show the Cartesian that I've been doing I don't know if they like that

786
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
Still

787
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:55,103
So I don't know

788
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,431
Cartesian in the act like I'm not dealing

789
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:04,831
Because in order for me to know where I am the 3D space I have to be able to give a matrix to the videogame to say yo but the

790
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Camera here

791
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:12,255
As soon as I get the video game looked at Matrix

792
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:18,399
After a lot of other math but I'm going to find out real soon that Cindy really painful but I'm just going to power through it and hope for the best

793
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,727
I can get there I'm pretty sure I can just like

794
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,335
Witches did hopes everything will be fine like

795
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,407
Terrible but fine

796
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:35,807
But now I do need to know where the camera is in 3D space in order to do that and I need to know where my little ESP

797
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:45,279
I will not be done just in time for 1 KB challenge even if I was

798
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:51,679
And I already mentioned before I don't think I'm going to be competing in the one KB challenge cuz somebody already wrote in operating system

799
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,007
It is it

800
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:01,407
Had the text editor a compiler it's got a file system it's got everything in one sale by

801
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
Yeah that was so crazy

802
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,039
Any racist to hear

803
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
Okay there we go so why is it

804
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,167
Freaking out sometimes

805
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,239
What is causing it to wig

806
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:38,015
Just make some changes my algorithm maybe I need to revert that

807
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,927
Oh no I have not done get reverting in so long

808
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,023
I'm doing it live terrible

809
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,423
Suburban

810
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,239
No no wait

811
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:02,591
I know you would never use Stevia nowadays

812
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
How do I view history

813
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351
History history are you history

814
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,911
History

815
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:32,031
Call Haley that button right there says that puller should make triangulation easier

816
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
But

817
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:39,455
They want nothing to do with that mask

818
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
Going to use them initially to determine the location for Lighthouse and then once and not even that I'm going to

819
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
Actually use the color

820
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:53,279
Poke color coordinate polar coordinates to determine the optimal pose with respect

821
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,839
To the

822
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,679
Stimulated

823
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
Triangle thing going on make sure we get the position correct of the the cameras

824
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
Everything else in Cartesian

825
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,063
You might have missed it this is free number 5 practice

826
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,583
Git checkout the branch how do you do it

827
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:35,519
Just check out

828
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,919
I did not copy and paste that I intended to

829
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:54,719
Says just stick to Cartesian

830
01:10:54,975 --> 01:11:01,119
Finding the centroid of that funny shape becomes much easier if that particular thing is in

831
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,519
Polar coordinate

832
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
Where the lighthouses are

833
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,735
Long-wear watermelon way from meeting care about polar coordinates

834
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:22,111
I think that I think so

835
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:28,511
I mean I don't think we have to care about polar but I just think that polar will produce a better centroid like the gaussian

836
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:33,375
Revolution will not be this funky shell which is not God and it would become a gaussian distribution

837
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,191
Which you can relatively easily find the

838
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,215
The centroid of

839
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,039
Okay how do you do this now is that right that work

840
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,535
Little freaking out

841
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:08,447
No it is not till freaking out so clearly something broken the last couple

842
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,519
RAB and we're going to probably have to figure that out

843
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,591
Totally

844
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:22,783
Much better right now

845
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,343
See how close I get this

846
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,391
I thought it

847
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:33,791
So what were actually looking at is the the position from the lighthouses point of view

848
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:38,911
Of all of the dots on the front of the face of the bhmd

849
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,751
The one on the left is the lighthouse that's on the side

850
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:49,151
And then the one on the right just one right here is the lighthouse that's up to the upper left-hand

851
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,967
Corner of the unity sign

852
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,063
Okay there I see it better now it was just

853
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:03,743
You were talking about it but I was watching The Stream So.

854
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:08,863
I wish that I had the lighthouse in view

855
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,423
Okay so

856
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,727
Cancel that

857
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,543
Figure out where this all went wrong

858
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,591
Some something went wrong somewhere

859
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:27,295
Oh you know what this is going to be hard because his pretty much supersedes mine

860
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,695
Understand Version Control

861
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
Cephas works

862
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
Somebody says you should make a Discord

863
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
What's the Discord

864
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,959
Discord is a new voice and chat

865
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,031
Program basically it's like having this

866
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,359
But live all the time and it's long so your messages

867
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:55,199
I received for people that don't know what I guess basically

868
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:01,087
But it has built-in voice chat too so you can do voice chat rooms as well as like multiple different chat rooms

869
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,743
Are you can assign people different roles like moderators Frosted Flake engineer's or whatever

870
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,815
But it's not in the YouTube chat so

871
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:16,447
It would give people a place for if they find something there to post it and believe it

872
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:22,591
Similar to the issues except it's more fluid okay

873
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,407
Discord is the value

874
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:31,551
If you want to set it up for next time I'm up for it right now though I would like to know the same

875
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,367
So let's see if this fix that

876
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,975
Right now I'm just bug fixing stops if you don't like bug fixing

877
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,791
Not going to be your your day

878
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,119
What is going on why can't it

879
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:59,199
Oh that's right this was after I started getting the data from the

880
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,759
Okay time power on the Watchmen

881
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:08,415
I unfortunately changed things a little bit so it requires the Watchman to be online

882
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,951
So can pull the config from them

883
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
These guys are now

884
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,423
Got fire them up

885
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,543
I'll look into making a Discord server for you and I'll send you the info

886
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,335
Okay

887
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Noel

888
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Logo

889
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
I'll go

890
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,263
Okay

891
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,967
So I have a random question

892
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,319
Neurologist Yates and

893
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,159
Then we have to have a better name for you

894
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,583
In your estimation how long is this going to take us to get to where we want to be are we talkin like

895
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,911
30 live streams or like

896
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,239
What can we just call him Uncle Ben

897
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,287
Uncle Ben

898
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
Turn off

899
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Yeah

900
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:52,095
I just turned back on the Watchmen turn off on their own to some reason

901
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:58,495
Yeah well I mean I get to make sense if I stopped using it really good

902
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
You can look up how long it took you

903
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:15,903
Oh that's not good that's going to be getting data from these

904
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
Free

905
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,607
It depends how much gets done live versus between sessions

906
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,775
I am shooting for a

907
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:38,431
Maybe about 33% lives 66% behind-the-scenes like

908
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,247
I spent like 4 hours last night just

909
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:47,903
Banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why why the timing on my bank order stuff was all wrong

910
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,439
Embarrassing

911
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,767
I'm really dumb reasons

912
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,375
Oh how do you like the term been coating to in

913
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
That was the

914
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
What

915
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:16,831
Did you say you know I know the bank holding that's going on with the

916
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
The Watchmen

917
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,975
Would you say that the lighthouse intersection is Ben coming

918
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
No it would be

919
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,911
He does not name everything after himself

920
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,567
Don't know then Cody remember

921
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,919
When you do something and you give it to the world or the internet or somebody

922
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:48,319
It becomes theirs and they get to determine how is pronounce so like gift or gift

923
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,903
Even though the Creator maintain their called GIFs

924
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,255
Because the internet now owns gifts we've named them gifts

925
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,791
And they will be gapped

926
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:06,495
And we pronounce the name of animals giraffes

927
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:13,663
I don't really want to get to like all of my plan to the Lattimer just really lost a little embarrassing but I really really really want to get to eat

928
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:20,063
82-66 tracking in the scope of a system with the entire system being honest

929
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,599
Of its own

930
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,951
So we don't actually have to

931
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:32,351
I'd like rely on any of the libraries and we don't have to rely on anything open-source libraries

932
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:36,191
We got now face Italy found out a lot more incomplete than I ever realized

933
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:39,775
And more data

934
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,335
Then I have patient for

935
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,687
Esp8266 is 160 +

936
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:52,575
Esp32 is 240 MHz esp32 is dual-core we'll just see what happens

937
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
Go back to the newest

938
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:21,760
Acer says the SPs expensive compared to the 8266

939
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,320
Esp32

940
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,824
The $3 piece

941
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,384
Cheap as dirt

942
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:55,296
How much is a Navy 266xp 8285 for a dollar

943
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
I think

944
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:02,720
86 Oz are $2 with the 86 on the board everything else for two bucks so

945
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,792
Box yeah

946
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:09,632
Agassi would require an extra chip and all but you know you're talkin a buck

947
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:21,664
Getting something shipped from America to Denmark will cost me a month's rent

948
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,016
No I will ship it to you for $2 and

949
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,184
What is it $2 note $3.15 from us like anywhere in the world

950
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,512
Do you mean you wanted on a dead Ford yeah good luck with that

951
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:49,568
Still freaking out sometime

952
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:54,432
That's how I do it if I want to go to eBay and I I buy them

953
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:58,272
I buy them from

954
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,576
From from the sky here

955
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,440
Guy says taobao is amazing

956
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,792
If you can read Chinese

957
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:18,240
Specifically I'm not actually allowed to say where I get the distributor for most of the

958
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,568
Scott rotch if he's that I'm aware of so

959
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,104
I do have

960
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,504
I'm actually the guy who fell from everybody and I unfortunately I'm not really able to say who might have to get

961
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,320
Need the chip to go to 32 everybody else so

962
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,536
I just checked out master that means on the new one right

963
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,328
Sure Thang

964
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:49,216
Twerking

965
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,544
Sure what's going on here

966
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,416
Better watch out somebody's 12-yard microchip Mafia

967
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
There's nothing

968
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,072
Illegal about what I'm doing that I'm aware

969
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
I think

970
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,264
No, I don't want to copy that I want to

971
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:29,152
I'm not going to look at that bird

972
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,248
I think I can just India just go buy it off eBay

973
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,528
Try to find a way

974
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:47,584
By the way that's not just a selling point of the esp8266 that is

975
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,984
The magic of the esp8266 is that it is somehow they will FCC license the module

976
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
Without having a

977
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,592
Without already having to have the

978
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:03,712
Power supply and everything built into the module which I don't understand how they did

979
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,016
Cuz I thought the rules were pretty clear on that

980
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:10,368
Probably did it and so I'm good with that I'm more than happy to

981
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:15,232
Use the wonderfulness that some person got ft certified

982
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:56,448
If you plan on stop

983
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:02,848
Stop using the 66 S430 to dance around in time I might reduce my

984
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:09,248
But they really a different purposes so on this particular project with light survive

985
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,904
Ddst instead of E85 which are the esp8266 with the black built-in

986
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:22,560
Would be really good for just having one esp-4 Center cuz it can sample at 80 MHz

987
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,608
Ethiopian

988
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:28,192
Have tons of frosting is 150 MHz / LED

989
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:33,312
And then you can back up the change because they're only a buck up heat

990
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Like

991
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
You can just use them everywhere but the sp32 is four different projects for much bigger project 1

992
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,552
Okay I need to go talk to like a camera

993
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,112
Or I need to be able to like I don't know

994
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,672
Do serious lifting like things like

995
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:56,608
Big project but the esp8266 still spectacular for any kind of small price

996
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:07,360
Yeah you know what I am going to I'm starting to acknowledge that there's just no way to get serious work

997
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,944
I just made a really loud okay

998
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:18,880
That that yeah any kind of theories work really has got to get done offline at least for a while I think we really lucked out on the fur

999
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,928
First few live live streams

1000
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,208
Where

1001
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:26,048
Where I was somehow able to work and focus at the same time but

1002
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:29,888
Yeah that was clearly a short-lived phenomenon

1003
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:36,288
You've never been much of a speak and code type person either have you know I've never been a freaking code person

1004
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,360
I'm trying to get but

1005
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:52,160
And right now all I'm trying to do is just figure out what in the world is going on so the chief pathologist says the penny

1006
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:58,304
Dean and Elena first to get anywhere

1007
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,912
Right now trying to figure out if

1008
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,960
This disintegrator

1009
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,800
Trying to figure out where things went wrong

1010
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
Ftfe

1011
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:19,296
Pacer says that they have to pay $24 fee for import duties for anything more than $11

1012
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,904
Pacer that's just fine because he has keys are cheap as dirt

1013
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:24,928
So

1014
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,200
Might try the new disambiguation her and the old one and the

1015
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:53,600
Maybe was somewhere else in the tree that change that I'm unaware of

1016
01:27:55,904 --> 01:28:00,256
What is a gift bisect I do not know what it is thank you want to do that right now

1017
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:07,424
That's better, I've never done an operation with get before I don't want to do the operation live on air

1018
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,472
I guess not really are

1019
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,008
But

1020
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:15,872
I guess some people where they have Wi-Fi connections their houses

1021
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,944
Stop thinking

1022
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,736
Stop thinking

1023
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:33,792
Are there any types of movements we need big tires rotation of headset and translation

1024
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:40,192
Translation

1025
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,552
Somebody's husband

1026
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,368
I need a question time or something

1027
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,952
Yeah I do need to focus a little bit more on

1028
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:06,048
Separating out when I'm actually focusing on working

1029
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,120
Talking to people

1030
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,424
But I'm pretty adhd's.

1031
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,240
So hard to deal

1032
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:20,384
I'm probably not any better than you on that either so

1033
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,944
This is probably a terrible combination

1034
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,856
I should probably go out farther than I am right now but I'm just kind of like

1035
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,160
There's so much going on

1036
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
What's up

1037
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,816
I know that

1038
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,032
Isaac automated binary Servpro blog

1039
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:54,432
Marquis commit as good or bad and it lets you move on to the next contestant

1040
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:57,504
Palm

1041
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:01,344
Yes that does sound like something really good

1042
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:08,512
Painter if you would like for you to pacifically do you buy it off me on eBay

1043
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,536
And you Market

1044
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,888
I will if you're willing to not tell anybody what the actual cost is

1045
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:20,288
I will mark it as the actual cost on your eBay thing and you will not have to pay the

1046
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,360
The that particular import fee

1047
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,736
But please Market as you because you know you have that problem

1048
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:39,744
I don't think that's it it looks like the problem might be somewhere else

1049
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
Where else could it be though

1050
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,608
The new one

1051
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,824
Heck I don't even know if it's is wrong or right I mean it looks pretty good

1052
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,888
It looks better

1053
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,168
Yeah but I'm not

1054
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,752
Check out master

1055
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,992
Oh yeah wow it is host

1056
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,088
So what in the world is going on there

1057
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:37,856
What

1058
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,672
Just completely hose

1059
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:45,024
Icy Point jumping all over the place

1060
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
Whoa

1061
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,352
So that was when I did the

1062
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,656
Check

1063
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:54,752
Something between the two of those really bad yeah

1064
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,592
Okay maybe we do need to actually do some

1065
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,760
Who is the what

1066
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:12,160
Who is the person who suggested using it bisects you have any very good references for

1067
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:16,256
For me to try to use get bisect cuz they both sound like the correct thing to do

1068
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,816
Animal 1111

1069
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,608
Can you

1070
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:24,960
Animal honey if you can just

1071
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,776
Pasting a reference cuz I'm willing to try right now

1072
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:35,712
I don't actually know what files changed here and also I'm used to operating in a much higher resolution but

1073
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:42,368
GitHub in

1074
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,160
K Mix-Ups Warframe slips

1075
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,952
Yes I have definitely noticed that

1076
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:50,816
I'm not really worried about clearing out the JK Mix-Ups right now

1077
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:57,216
I will be later but usually when I'm doing the tests the thing sitting in the middle

1078
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:01,056
Where things broke because I do clearly have code that works much

1079
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
Better butt

1080
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,456
Don't know what's up with this

1081
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,136
Yeah that's

1082
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,184
I've heard that a lot robbed

1083
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,744
Definitely heard that a lot

1084
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,560
What do you say

1085
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,888
List of the best coders are somewhere on the Spectrum

1086
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,960
I can believe that I might be I don't know

1087
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:36,640
That was not even the same what I was growing up but I have very little doubt and if I was throwing up nowadays they would have said that that was the problem

1088
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
Dumb

1089
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,160
Things

1090
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,536
Do you need those over there or can you send them to me to keep trying them on

1091
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,096
No I just

1092
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,544
In the world

1093
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:11,200
What changed in that pipeline between those two

1094
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:27,328
I'm going to do something stupid because I cannot bring the livestream myself live streaming

1095
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:37,312
Oh yeah that was like an intermediate one

1096
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
You're saying good bad is this literally what you type gets good goodbye text good

1097
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:04,960
And then I get commit and then get bisect bad head

1098
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,312
Charles the telling you

1099
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,848
But you have to get good

1100
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:16,224
Does best advice I've ever received one of my boxes in my past

1101
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,624
Courier jobs

1102
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,672
Sun live streaming us live streaming

1103
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,536
I don't know why it just

1104
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
Sounded like a good idea at the time

1105
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,472
Okay I'm not

1106
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,872
I'm going to call this one good

1107
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,224
Let's do that I'm going to learn something new today get 5 sect

1108
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
Start

1109
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
Get

1110
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,576
Bisect good

Bad

1114
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
Head

1115
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,776
What did I do wrong

1116
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:24,064
I'm about ready to just not do that and just revert some code but

1117
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,560
Do I have to check out Alpine

1118
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
Checked out bad

1119
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
What is it

1120
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,456

Here on the Sha

1124
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,560
I don't know but I thought that was

1125
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,656
Past Maya knowledge of get now

1126
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,472

What

1128
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:27,040
Firewood SVN guy man I'm so out of my element

1129
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,856
Here

1130
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:35,232
Do git bisect reset before you start again

1131
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,072
Because you checked out an unlabeled commit

1132
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,496
Nope

1133
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,824
Wow I'm just terrible at the Opera tonight

1134
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:55,456

Commit

1140
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,432
Oh great things are broken now

1141
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:35,136
This is why I was afraid of trying to get things now it's Mastercool and origin right

1142
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,464
Liked it like completely

1143
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,512
Reset it or does it ever get

1144
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:49,472
Oh hahaha it's all falling apart

1145
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:52,288
That is what you have checked out your check out failed

1146
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,336
No it's pretty happy to me

1147
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,456
Today

1148
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:05,344
Someone said he's Master instead of head

1149
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,464
Getmycheck reset menus Master instead of head

1150
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:17,120
Data

1151
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,912
Hey get

1152
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,984
Hi

1153
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,008
Of the head

1154
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
Get

1155
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,336
Check out

1156
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,896
Had

1157
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,176
Okay

1158
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,456
Then

1159
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:35,296
Get bisect

1160
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:40,160
Okay what do I do next let's do Twix plays

1161
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:46,560
Yeah

1162
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:50,912
I will ever do is never open this one again

1163
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,776
I will edit it to like the first 10 minutes are always day

1164
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,160
Give it to explain

1165
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,792
Easier to understand get them to use get

1166
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,400
Hubris in a terrible way

1167
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,496
So what they're saying is they get it

1168
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:47,744
Whenever I see these things like we are not bisecting I just imagine them being said and Linus Torvalds voice

1169
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
I just

1170
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,400
It's so weird

1171
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:01,056
Do is copy the last commit from GitHub instead of using head

1172
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,824
Wow whatever this commit was broke everything

1173
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:11,200
How do I mark this one is I did a thing

1174
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:14,528
If I want to move on I know this is bad I just want to

1175
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,112
Say okay what do I do next

1176
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,416
See what is it today

1177
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,328
Get bicycle skip

1178
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,864
Skip

1179
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,192
Do I want to say bad or skip skip

1180
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,008
Skip from two different people okay

1181
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,104
Okay well that once also bad

1182
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,736
Todd building again

1183
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,784
Duke Lane

1184
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:58,048
Yay the internet Charles how to use get thank-you internet

1185
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,984
I'm going to open up a new ticket cuz this has happened a few times before

1186
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,312
Do not know why

1187
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:16,224
Sometimes data just stopped flowing from the hmd

1188
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,784
Don't know why

1189
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,344
Sometimes

1190
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:28,256
The HMV randomly decide

1191
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:36,448
Even when finding the light on Magic

1192
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:45,408
Apparently you using git bisect to on a large codebase is a nightmare

1193
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,456
Beloved principal butt

1194
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:53,344
It gets ugly know I'm sending it the power on command I'm sending it that magic thing

1195
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:56,928
But the mattress have to unplug and

1196
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,488
Replug

1197
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,512
Wait a minute

1198
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,840
Waking up.

1199
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:06,656
Define don't know why

1200
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:13,056
Stainsby magic like if I plug it in my run it I doesn't give me any data until I send the magic spell to go turn on

1201
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
Magic is

1202
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
Oh what is the magic

1203
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:20,992
Power on command is located here

1204
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,208
It's this one

1205
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,512
I hope you can read that

1206
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,048
I know it's terrible

1207
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:40,448
But this this thing here totally does it saying I copy and pasted it from like a

1208
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:43,776
Wireshark session with the

1209
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:47,104
Somebody I think Meryl was the guy who published that

1210
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:58,112
Yeah then wants to know what the power on command is

1211
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,416
No I know I just showed it to him

1212
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:07,328
Then if you want to know it's just Vive underscore magic underscore power underscore on

1213
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:15,776
Okay I'm going to go

1214
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,800
Rock Solid

1215
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,592
It is just

1216
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,128
Like foam

1217
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:26,016
Track track track track track track

1218
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,112
Price it now say git bisect

1219
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
Good

1220
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,720
You done got cut

1221
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,328
0 revision

1222
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:50,336
So if this kid is good say get my some good I'm going with this is terrible

1223
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:00,064
Yeah if it's bad to terrible

1224
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:06,976
So if I move this around it like randomly like you'll see it go like straight on the diagonals and stuff

1225
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,768
I like that it's totally hosed

1226
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,584
IPic

1227
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,912
The points to finally jump out along the way

1228
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
Did you make

1229
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,312
Yes

1230
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,128
I did not make clean that time but I mean not

1231
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,688
Great I don't even know how to go back to it

1232
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,808
Okay so what do I do how do I tell the difference

1233
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:35,136
So I do get myself Ana

1234
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,208
Goodbye

1235
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:46,400
What do I do what do I do I see numbers and hatches and junk that I don't understand

1236
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:48,960
All I see is git bisect bad

1237
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,520
Get show

1238
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,824
Okay

1239
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:03,808
Oh okay that might be a problem

1240
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,352
No

1241
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:18,656
Chilling Yulia the definition

1242
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,448
Yeah

1243
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:27,872
So that makes sense why that would be outside of that codes that's all stuff I've already manually made sure was fine

1244
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,992
That stuff here is down in the The Watchmen disambiguated stuff

1245
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:38,368
Dino is good so it looks like it's just this thing right here

1246
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,584
How do I stop it

1247
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,376
Bisect

1248
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
Cancel

1249
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,960
Stop

1250
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,264
Rita

1251
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,056
Okay

1252
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,872
Git checkout head

1253
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
After after

1254
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
Yeah

1255
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:09,600
Master head in origin I have no idea what the difference between

1256
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:14,208
At one point I probably could have told you but now I don't remember

1257
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:22,400
I think it's like Master is actually wear the new one is in Heathers was pointing to An Origin is the actual repository where it lives

1258
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:24,448
But I would have a hard time with

1259
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:30,848
Masters the name of the brand so hopefully it should be bad right now

1260
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,456
Head is always the Sham checked out

1261
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,016
An Origin is GitHub in this case

1262
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:44,416
Masters Branch name head is

1263
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:59,520
Get whatever they think it bisects head it was like I have no idea what you're talking about because

1264
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,312
I was still on the Old Branch

1265
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,616
I could have been active in like master

1266
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:07,200
Somebody wants to know if they can get the source code for Unity sign

1267
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,040
Yes I get home

1268
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:16,160
Yes for the unity sign it is GitHub.com

1269
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:22,816
PN lore updp 6832 2012 i2f

1270
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,888
Right here

1271
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,472
I think they said in chat

1272
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,152
Wait what did we do to USB valve. See

1273
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,480
Wait what do you mean

1274
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:43,296
Oh no no no no

1275
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:49,696
No I don't know what any of those b mean in there I just know that you guys puked it out at the headset sometime

1276
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:55,072
If I puke it out of the headset to that might make it do what I want

1277
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:59,424
I puked it out the headset and it made it do what I want most of the time

1278
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,056
Oh never mind now I feel like an idiot

1279
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:08,640
Okay so this is broken let's go fix it

1280
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,688
I think it's right

1281
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,968
Year

1282
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:15,296
That was commenting that out

1283
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:23,744
The same

1284
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,600
Why is it read only

1285
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,136
What is going on here

1286
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,928
Nope still freaking it out

1287
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,088
There is mounting the chocolate here

1288
01:51:54,624 --> 01:52:00,000
On the dining room kitchen

1289
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:04,352
Yeah you said dining room

1290
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:08,448
Chocolate we're still trying to get rid of all of her Halloween candy

1291
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:15,104
Take anything you want

1292
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,712
Nope

1293
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:28,672
You want I should have gone I should have written down the stuff from get by text so I would have been able to go back to it

1294
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,536
But I'm guessing it seems like they get bicycle done

1295
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:41,728
The chief religious says he should just write another descendant you later for you know

1296
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,264
Ray what's another one

1297
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:50,944
There's enough other problems right now it's not just the disambiguation or something is just what it was

1298
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,736
Working the other day too

1299
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
Although now

1300
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:06,048
You know what I'm going to use the Charles mechanism for finding this which is totally like the subversion awful

1301
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:11,168
Let's just go do that

1302
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
Survive

1303
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,048
Remember what I said about

1304
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,864
Poet holtby Catalyst for me to in math

1305
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
Milkshake

1306
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:53,408
Begley milkshakes right now

1307
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,856
Unless there's like stuff in the freezer that I don't know about Brandon

1308
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:12,864
I got to a good of it I'm trying to take a more complex situation just to be able to shed this expense into the more complex

1309
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:23,104
You write an app that makes more sense to me

1310
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,688
Basic things like

1311
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:31,040
Usurping the compost thing for my slowly got more complicated

1312
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:36,416
I guess not worry said like there's that whole costume Shake in there

1313
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:42,304
There's a whole frosting shaky ideas to things that are closer to the The Watch

1314
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,608
Like if I move it up and down

1315
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:51,008
If I'm closer to it than the Delta angle Delta's appeared much larger cuz that's all we really know is he

1316
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
Engel Beltre

1317
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,176
We don't know position relative to Lighthouse really no angles

1318
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:05,600
I am not speaking a language I am speaking in terms okay

1319
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:09,440
Do you want to talk about this right now

1320
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,048
How confident are you that this is

1321
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,584
Something to go down

1322
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,984
I wanted to finish the complex situation first

1323
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,032
Chocolate milkshake

1324
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,568
Well

1325
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:27,872
I mean the closest milkshake would be like

1326
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,432
7-Eleven sell

1327
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:34,272
Yeah I don't think anything else is open tonight

1328
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:37,088
Crackdonalds probably even

1329
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,904
Wawa cookout

1330
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,440
Cookout

1331
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,232
They don't have cookout in the North

1332
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,096
For reference the

1333
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:54,496
Charlottesville or Harrisonburg

1334
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,568
Voice

1335
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,896
Is he your making a lot of sense.

1336
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:07,296
Mindy is person you're hearing disembodied voices stand over this way

1337
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:13,696
Well if you want to work that true I'm confident that we will still have time to do it cuz we're only up to

1338
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:21,376
Oh gosh what is that workout to what's wrong

1339
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:26,496
Your master is making sense and that you we should continue down whatever path you are speaking

1340
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:32,896
Okay

1341
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:42,112
Okay how about that lets you that that's a good way to start so doctor doctor phrenologist

1342
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:48,512
That phonology hi Mindy

1343
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:54,912
I'm into one of the bases that that I think maybe in correct me if I'm wrong Mindy that you're coming from is the idea that that you

1344
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:57,984
You may not need to know Lighthouse locations

1345
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,056
Okay also sugar equals math

1346
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,872
Chocolate specifically

1347
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:11,808
Is she going to become a farala just too and we just I don't understand

1348
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:21,024
Degree to be the smartest person in the room so

1349
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,816
If we have just discovered now

1350
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:31,008
There's different types of intelligence Charles Sledgehammer to code problem

1351
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:37,408
Until they do what I tell him

1352
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:43,808
Bncollege don't see eye-to-eye at all

1353
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:47,392
Ulysses trying to kill me right now so

1354
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,728
You guys have any coffee grounds

1355
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:06,848

1356
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,944
Apparently

1357
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:14,784

Digging through the Charles mad

02:00:58,112 --> 02:01:00,416
Maybe it's like what incident command

1389
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,184
Paris

1390
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:09,120
Parasuicidal boy and that guy but maybe we can move from the light

1391
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:15,008
Trying to classify a dynamic duo that hold that we don't really like we we interact with

1392
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,032
Sparingly

1393
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:19,872
Yeah okay okay we're moving we're moving we're moving

1394
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:26,784
You know there's computers to do the more complex situation

1395
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:31,648
And maybe if we get there you can help me do that but

1396
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,792
Can I do this

1397
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:41,376
Are you ready to talk it over with

1398
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:44,448
First ask

1399
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,264
Don't know what happened to my codebase

1400
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:52,128
I'll keep working on this so

1401
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,736
Who here wants to hear Mindy's

1402
02:01:58,016 --> 02:02:02,368
Ideas of how to do this without finding the location of the lighthouses

1403
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:03,904
Go

1404
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:13,632
I mean you're going to get it whether you want it or not. Okay

1405
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:20,032
Here at least that around this way and Willamette

1406
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:23,104
Camera down at you

1407
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:30,016
Now it's time for Lindy's math corner

1408
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:34,880
Significantly simpler than Dave's math time

1409
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,928
Make video bigger

1410
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:41,792
I think if we're going to you might want to make the video that I actually shows what

1411
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,328
He's doing

1412
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:49,984
Barramundi

1413
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:54,080
Loosen a video of her over top of where the CO2 showing

1414
02:02:54,592 --> 02:03:00,736
Basically people want to be able to see her white board more clearly

1415
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:07,136
I mean this is super complex and soul

1416
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:13,536
Okay well hold on let me let me switch it so

1417
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:23,776
Plus I haven't talked about how to tell any of you this so this might be wrong

1418
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:32,224
I will hopefully figure out how to get this all merge together while she's explaining it to

1419
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:38,368
We now have that you are the voice of reason I can hazmats and The Mindy Project

1420
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:44,768
No

1421
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:57,312
I was looking at doing where I want to go to closer

1422
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:11,392
Well hello there we go

1423
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:13,184
Charlton to work

1424
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:20,096
Mark here for this

1425
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,632
I don't know

1426
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:30,592
Phrenologist says oh God we're old

1427
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:36,224
Mork & Mindy thing

1428
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:49,792
Walmart antennas go ahead and explain don't worry we'll tell you if you don't understand okay and you guys will handle that

1429
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:56,192
Well I can go try to bug the code right at timer 125

1430
02:04:56,448 --> 02:05:02,592
Wentworth with the first time then we'll go back and try to explain it better the second time can you see me can we see the board

1431
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:08,992
Only the board do we want to see you

1432
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,952
That looks like I got the light fixed

1433
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,328
Okay yeah

1434
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:27,936
OK Google

1435
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:34,336
Nope that's fine

1436
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:46,112
Okay it's all my hypothesis is that you don't need to know where the lighthouses are at

1437
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:52,512
You only need to know like some of the First Data we got was like I think someone stated it was only relative

1438
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:55,840
Positions positions and I was like

1439
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,888
Thinking about it and I was like yeah

1440
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:00,448
That's nice of elegant

1441
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:05,056
Actually because that's all you outside with Dinah you really want me and anyway

1442
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:13,248
And so I really hope you're talking so bear with me on this one I might lose my voice

1443
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:17,344
So I'm assuming

1444
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:23,744
That we are using six sensors on the headset

1445
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:32,192
And I realize this headset has points in the xy&z direction

1446
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:35,264
And that's really useful

1447
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:41,664
Minnesota rethinking about a problem you never taken a Physics course you always want to be like all my nose what are absolutely

1448
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,968
Don't change that I can rely on

1449
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:50,368
I realize that the headset the distance between all of these sensors

1450
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:56,768
Where you are then

1451
02:06:57,024 --> 02:07:03,168
Speaking of distances and translations of the z-axis

1452
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:08,544
We just performed an example of one of those things are a few

1453
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,104
Nevermind

1454
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:14,688
Really don't like talking

1455
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:18,272
Okay now everything is in to you including you

1456
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:28,000
I made some marks on it and

1457
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:34,400
Homes are the distances between these sensors so I mark

1458
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:36,448
Three sensors

1459
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:43,360
On Eastside 1A 2A and 3A and I pick

1460
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:47,712
This one specifically because these ones with have a nice elegant like

1461
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:54,368
Right in the middle very obvious very in front and then I picked these two because

1462
02:07:54,624 --> 02:08:00,768
Today seems to be in line with these two down here and so I can kind of just

1463
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:07,168
Whatever I do the math it gives me quite a few zeros to work with and zero as a really nice

1464
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:11,008
Gypsum

1465
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:13,824
Then I worked out some actual numbers

1466
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:17,664
For determining the distances between

1467
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:24,576
These and kind of like a generic faky unit because I don't really care how many centimeters or millimeters of these actually

1468
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:30,976
We are the computer probably doesn't know that either so

1469
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,256
For each thing is

1470
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:36,864
Yeah but it doesn't matter what you wanted is for the sake of what I'm doing right now

1471
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:40,960
So I assume that these two are basically two units away from each other

1472
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:51,456
Actually sorry I use these two but he took the stickers off and became ambiguous

1473
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,528
Using those two sensors

1474
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:01,184
Resume these rtn sway from each other in the

1475
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:07,584
X-axis and they are 0 units from each other in the y-axis and in the Z

1476
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:13,984
Access these two are about halfway in between the slang

1477
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:20,384
Asymmetry and the sensor over here so I kind of assumed this was one unit these are one

1478
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,432
Away from each other

1479
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:29,600
And so basically a half unit to the midpoint hacking it to the midpoint and here I assume these were

1480
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:33,184
These words in the same

1481
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,768
Why location as these to appear

1482
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:43,168
These two are also one unit away from each other a half unit

1483
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,960
From the midpoint hacking

1484
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:53,920
And then there's some z-axis stuff if you're still looking at it head-on

1485
02:09:54,176 --> 02:10:00,320
Then in the z-axis there's some difference between there's no difference between the a the one

1486
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,600
2A

1487
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:03,648
To b-1b

1488
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:07,744
And there is a difference between the 12

1489
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,816
Or the 1A

1490
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:15,936
3A Andy 2A 3A

1491
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:22,592
And bison the same for the other side as well and so then you have some z-axis information as well

1492
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:31,040
Eventually I made some assumptions about how far those were from each other and that's what all of these numbers are down here

1493
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:37,696
That's what all of these numbers are down here

1494
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,768
So

1495
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:52,544
So these are the initial positions essentially from each other as I said

1496
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:55,872
This is change in x

1497
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:56,896
4

1498
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:01,504
The set of ones

1499
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,856
They do right here is the change in x

1500
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:08,160
For the son of Wands

1501
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:11,488
This is the change in X for the set of twos

1502
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:14,816
And this is the change in X for the set of threes

1503
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:16,096
Down here

1504
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:22,496
This change in X being like the distance and eventually or don't want to think a distance is time

1505
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,824
Sounds kind of weird but

1506
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:31,200
That goes back to what our nuns are constants are it sounds like these

1507
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,504
Motors

1508
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:36,320
Emit light

1509
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:41,440
Will do so in a constant frequency so no matter what

1510
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:46,304
I know the frequency is I haven't really been listening half the time

1511
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,376
. if you thinking text one full Revolution

1512
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:56,032
Is a little bit too specific

1513
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:59,872
Okay 800,000

1514
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:01,920
I don't even know that

1515
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:05,504
Okay

1516
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,528
So

1517
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:12,672
Whatever something sweeps it will always sleep in the same amount of time

1518
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:15,232
Oh so you can use that to your advantage

1519
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:18,304
Explain an hour later since I mean

1520
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:26,752
So then I was like you don't we can even figure out the distance Not Just Between the set of Wands tattoo

1521
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:29,056
The distance between like

1522
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:31,872
1 a.m. tree

1523
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:35,456
Or

1524
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:39,808
181 entryway and then train PA

1525
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:43,648
And all of those are going to the same thing as every other side cuz pretty symmetry

1526
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:50,560
Everything's fine

1527
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:54,144
Delia

1528
02:12:54,912 --> 02:13:01,056
Then I wasn't really sure what I was going to need it when it wasn't going to need so I went ahead and did some math and run to find the distance of a segment

1529
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:02,848
In real space

1530
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:09,504
To figure out like hey if I want to find the actual distance in real space between like 1 and 3 a.m.

1531
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,320
This little pretty equation up here

1532
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:18,720
Define the distance of a segment so far I don't know if I need it or not I haven't actually gone through and done more complex situation of some of the

1533
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:22,048
Movements but maybe that'll be used later on

1534
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,864
But just in case it is there

1535
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:31,776
Do I need to explain the nones more about how I know we're different

1536
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:38,176
Sensors are in a relation to each other that they are absolutely not going to be changing changing that's the most important point is that

1537
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,992
This will always be true

1538
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,296
If you hold

1539
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:49,696
T1 and T2 constancy 182 always be constant

1540
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:51,744
Respect to the headset constant

1541
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:58,144
With respect to the other sensor so like the space between these two sensors will never change

1542
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:04,544
I'm okay with that nobody else

1543
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,616
I said is it essentially proof that relative coordinates are good enough

1544
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:10,176
Yes

1545
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,552
That's the only thing

1546
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:22,720
I don't know if that's the only thing I'm really thought explain

1547
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:24,768
I think I understand what you're saying is

1548
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:31,168
Like like as long as we're sure because we are sure we're sure that the Physicians on headset do not change

1549
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:32,448
Relative to each other

1550
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,008
If it's sitting still

1551
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:42,432
They're visiting so you things are going to change except for like jittering Aaron all that whatever

1552
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:48,320
You can take that information and be like what does that mean something

1553
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:54,720
And I think what it could possibly be true is that if you see a change in one very specific

1554
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:57,792
That will mean one very specific type of movement

1555
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:04,448
For example if we want translation and if you want to see translation in the ax x axis than Siri

1556
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:05,984
This way

1557
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:11,104
Okay

1558
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:17,504
You can kind of think of the sweep as something that creates the court Cartesian

1559
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:22,624
Coordinate system for you and so assume is sweeping this way

1560
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:28,256
I like this point in space you can mark this basically as like

1561
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:30,816
Tu at 1

1562
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:34,400
As it passes by the next 12-unit to T3

1563
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:37,472
30 equals

1564
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:41,312
1 T equals 2 tbsp excetera 41

1565
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:45,920
And the same thing for 22 as it goes up and down you can still Marquez

1566
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:52,576
Whoever passes by this place is always be 21 22 23 24 25

1567
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:58,976
System for you by doing these

1568
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:01,024
Which I have no idea what kind of

1569
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:05,120
What

1570
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:11,776
Things other than what your wear like that if they've moved in the middle something bad things happen

1571
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:14,848
I don't really know

1572
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:21,248
Oh got ya belly band

1573
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,784
Freaks out

1574
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:25,856
That's appropriate for I'm hypothesizing so

1575
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,136
Cool

1576
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:29,696
Kind of bad but yeah

1577
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:37,120
You don't pump lighthouses if you do a minute

1578
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:43,520
I've always just stop and read in the whole room calibration

1579
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:47,872
It's like a like a teetering thing they can actually beat hi-yah

1580
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:51,200
But if you knocked about a position you're pretty

1581
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,736
What's crew

1582
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:57,344
Doctor virologist says

1583
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:02,976
I have never tried to formulate it without using the base station coordinate system the observation changes with motion

1584
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:08,096
Fly you to solve for the coordinate system so he thinks that this is possible

1585
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,632
Okay keep going

1586
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:10,656
Wendy

1587
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:17,824
Okay so what you can do with keeping his mind is that

1588
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:22,944
If you if you want translation along X so

1589
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:25,760
Anthony still and it moves this way

1590
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:27,040
Or this way

1591
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:30,624
Then the time at which then it receives like

1592
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:34,464
1234

1593
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:40,352
But if you move it this way then it's going to it's going to hit a little bit sooner is going to be 12

1594
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:42,144
Did not hit 34

1595
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:48,800
And so to think of this when a protective the headset because Lighthouse isn't actually do anything

1596
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:52,896
The headsets like oh hey I got it

1597
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:59,552
Repercussion comes in handy here so think of it in measures of 44

1598
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:02,624
But are looping through each other so you have like

1599
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:06,720
1234m is this way at all of a sudden

1600
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:13,120
Your measures become kind of like 1234 no hits if you think of it from this perspective iffy

1601
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:16,192
It's a bunch of looping like music measures

1602
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:22,592
By the way Captain Jackson says it's recording you

1603
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:28,992
The most important

1604
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:39,232
If you is a precise time from when this week happens

1605
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:42,304
You have to make constant adjustments internal Ada

1606
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:44,864
Will I keep everything perfectly in line

1607
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:48,448
Absolutely

1608
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:54,848
Yes I think so it's like a stabilizer

1609
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:57,408
I think his comments

1610
02:18:57,664 --> 02:19:03,808
A directed Jab

1611
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:06,368
Sorry sorry

1612
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:13,024
And Doctor Gates also says well you end up knowing where the bases are either in

1613
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:13,792
Implicitly

1614
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:19,168
It's some kind of stay for explicitly as blucian that use them directly

1615
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:19,936
Okay

1616
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:26,848
I think that's

1617
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:30,944
Why you really need to okay

1618
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:42,976
Translation want to access x-axis and then translation on the y-axis work the same exact way except like

1619
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:48,352
Instead of the measures going from side to side like you would see it and music measure all the and down

1620
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:51,680
Can awaken some music games

1621
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:58,336
And then if you have movement I want to see access something I noticed whenever we're at the cabin is

1622
02:19:58,592 --> 02:20:03,968
Your distances between your known sensors increase and decrease over here

1623
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:10,112
The distance between the two sensors these two sensors new sensors if you back it up

1624
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:15,744
The old seemed to increase in so in terms of time whenever you think of it that way

1625
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,072
It will kind of be

1626
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:21,376
Large room

1627
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,656
Changes

1628
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,680
In

1629
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:26,496
It's so here it will be like

1630
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:30,848
Bam Bam Bam hero be like bam

1631
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:35,456
Damn that's like hyperbole obviously won't slow down that much but

1632
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:40,832
It's an example of what will happen there and if you get it a lot closer than it's going to be like

1633
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:42,112
Bam Bam Bam

1634
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:46,720
And so that's if those hits

1635
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:50,560
Oil change in the X & Y axis

1636
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:57,216
I'm going to stay in a particular way that will have translation along the exercises EXs

1637
02:20:57,472 --> 02:21:03,616
There's a few questions so Mandy what you're saying makes sense to me but would

1638
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:05,920
Are you be able to know the absolute coordinate

1639
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:08,224
If you don't know where the lighthouses are

1640
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:20,512
Anyting so I guess I would have to do with more if you were inside of the room

1641
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:26,912
Would it be able to know like where you are in the room or like really if you start here

1642
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:31,776
There is more by the way

1643
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:35,360
Because you know I'm

1644
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:40,736
Can somebody else with a reasonable laptop

1645
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:45,344
Can you lock checked yet

1646
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,136
Are you can't pay Mike

1647
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:52,000
You come over here with the laptop cuz you can actually do you chat on it my laptop's like totally

1648
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:53,024
Not

1649
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:54,816
Okay

1650
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:56,608
Hold on

1651
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,376
Okay

1652
02:21:57,888 --> 02:22:00,704
The general idea

1653
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:05,312
Who sings in Grimes to punch a population challenge.

1654
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:14,784
Previously like astronomy might think about

1655
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:18,368
Crayon

1656
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:23,488
Are all the lighthouses are in the lowest anyway

1657
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,816
With the movement in X and Y and rotation

1658
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:34,496
Increase the time in history that was going to be where I go next

1659
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,920
Oh my gosh

1660
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:52,672
I'm going to keep explaining

1661
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:59,072
You can either end of it you can predictively kind of expected to become a later time so don't need to worry about

1662
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:00,096
Emotions

1663
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:06,752
Charles are you getting this I want one who having a hard time

1664
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:11,616
I'm I know I know that that is kind of cuz I'm probably the one who maybe the one who writes it

1665
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:23,392
Yeah

1666
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:24,416
What I do understand

1667
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:30,816
Is the idea of being able to measure everything with relative motions from where we are which I could probably like back until like

1668
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:33,376
Absolute positions from initial starting position

1669
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,400
But

1670
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:40,800
What I don't understand is as you would get closer or farther from a lighthouse

1671
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:42,336
That relationship

1672
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:48,736
Like if you move forward and then left and right versus a few move back and then left and right

1673
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:55,136
Situation surrounding try to get to you after I tried doing the basement

1674
02:23:55,392 --> 02:24:00,000
Complex thing

1675
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:06,400
Pecan

1676
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:09,216
El hogar we know that

1677
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:15,616
With invisible space rotation can happen translation can happen and really those are the only

1678
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:22,016
Two things I think we came up with so what I'm trying to do I guess right now is explained

1679
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:28,416
What eats like a profile position

1680
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:34,816
Single position profile

1681
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:41,216
Movements along translation along X Y and Z and rotation along x y and z

1682
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:47,616
And then after we kind of understand those basic six things and maybe we can get to a more complex situation where you are

1683
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:54,016
More like rotating and moving at the same time kind of why I'd be like hey let's have a computer help us try to do to calculations

1684
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:59,392
Because computers are great like that and I'm pretty sure to be probably already built stuff that can do that for us

1685
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:02,976
What is horses conceptualizing as I think these

1686
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:05,792
Base examples are probably what we need to import first

1687
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:10,656
Soda translation along x y and z

1688
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:20,384
Something also point out as far as our nose go is that whenever we are thinking

1689
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:25,760
About this movement and he sleeps while we need to know the information

1690
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:33,440
There is no way for us to blatantly be given the information we have to conclude all the information based off of

1691
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:35,744
Information that were given

1692
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,048
And is Cartesian system.

1693
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:41,376
The to sweep sideways and up and down give us

1694
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:47,776
And again I kind of showed that we can get in D by

1695
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:49,568
If all points

1696
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:52,128
Between X and Y

1697
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:54,944
Increase or decrease

1698
02:25:55,456 --> 02:26:01,600
If it just acts so that's whenever we get into rotation why does not change but

1699
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:04,928
Increases in all the sudden that kind of signaling signaling rotation

1700
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:11,584
ISO rotation along the x-axis will be like

1701
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:16,960
Kind of answer then you're having like your y-axis is getting smaller

1702
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:21,312
And then larger is fluctuating in the y-axis but not the sea

1703
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:25,664
X-axis and y-axis that we're not giving that information

1704
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:32,320
Stop by the sweeps rotation along the y-axis it will look like this and

1705
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:36,672
And that will be fluctuations in only the X and not the Y

1706
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:43,328
I don't know if you guys cut taxes

1707
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:46,656
If you rotate along this y-axis

1708
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:50,240
Then your space between

1709
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:55,360
Did axe is going to be slowly decreasing as a retainer and why

1710
02:26:55,872 --> 02:27:00,992
Full rotation of the z-axis which will be this thing coming here

1711
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:03,296
It will be like this

1712
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:08,928
And so this will be a change in X & Y

1713
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:15,584
In a very very different way than what you're seeing in all EX and why's increase and decrease that's not what's Happening Here

1714
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:21,984
It is a translation along X and Y and

1715
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,800
Minnesota defense isn't really changing in between them

1716
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:29,920
However these are cheap ones

1717
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:32,992
Change if you want to change the key to our changing

1718
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,552
Actually

1719
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:46,048
What is the score for a single lighthouse

1720
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:52,448
Inverse way to describe it from my point of view that you would be able to ride basically

1721
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:56,288
Function so different changes in particular aspect of

1722
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:57,568
Depose

1723
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:59,104
In

1724
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:03,968
In the lighthouse view like from lighthouses point-of-view even though it doesn't think

1725
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:06,784
Would have particular changes on the

1726
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:10,624
XYZ in 3D space

1727
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:15,232
I guess for me I only see that is really having an impact

1728
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:18,048
With one Lighthouse butt

1729
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:23,680
It still is within the divisors point-of-view or the headsets point-of-view

1730
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:28,544
So like if you say like translate X it's going to you're talking about translating

1731
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:30,080
Ax

1732
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:33,152
And like y&z

1733
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,176
But

1734
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:36,480
I guess from my point of view like from

1735
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:41,088
I don't know unless there's got to be a way of Translating that back to

1736
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:46,720
That's interesting so you'd be able to if you would even do it over an area you could then

1737
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:50,816
Make it so you can make transformation

1738
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:57,216
From like the the hmds local point-of-view so like this in this

1739
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:03,616
Become like where those go in 3D space cuz if the end of the day we do need to know

1740
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:08,224
Like with respect to the room where the headset is so we can render it from that point of view

1741
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:08,992
But

1742
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,576
I don't know why I got to think about that more cuz that would

1743
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:17,952
More than a specific solution

1744
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:27,168
I don't know why I still have to turn to this more for me at least I don't know

1745
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:42,784
I don't know what sponge sponge man is saying

1746
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:50,976
Not calculus linear algebra going to make do calculator

1747
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:52,768
Calculus

1748
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,304
.

1749
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:55,584
But

1750
02:29:56,096 --> 02:30:02,240
I don't think that you want to be integrating differences over time you'll never be able to handle the error Accu

1751
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,008
Malaysia

1752
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:08,128
So he saying is as you move like up and around and all of that

1753
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:13,760
You're going to like drift overtime and you're not going to be in the absolute space of the the area

1754
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:17,088
But now the thing that I wonder if a hybrid approach would work

1755
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:18,624
Where

1756
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:22,464
You kind of getting some sort of ground crew

1757
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:27,328
Complexity

1758
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:36,032
But we're really trying to do like 10 different things that anytime the same time TCL 987

1759
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:42,688
We are we basically all have ADHD the terrible project

1760
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,992
Umpd HGTV doing

1761
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:53,440
I don't actually have been says you are correct as far as there's a function that tells you

1762
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:57,536
Changes in Lighthouse measurements will imply changes impose

1763
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,888
But it's a function of the current pose

1764
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:08,800
At most abstract lighthouse

1765
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:16,480
Oh yeah except your question so been do you do strictly mean in relative post position or in some sense

1766
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:17,248
Absolutely

1767
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:25,440
My biggest question are all of these differences based on the potential initial initial position or all

1768
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:29,792
All of them based on the position it just came from

1769
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:33,376
Okay so all of these are building up off of each other so like

1770
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:36,960
Position with zero data is all of this base stuff

1771
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:43,616
And then you figure out position to buy this change but then all of a sudden

1772
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:44,896
New

1773
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:46,688
Information

1774
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:49,248
I like your pose

1775
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:52,320
Yeah I'm blending 0 12 + 12 + 3

1776
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,880
Your third position

1777
02:31:56,416 --> 02:32:02,304
Is going to be this but it's going to know that it's this based on this position

1778
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:04,608
Not disposition

1779
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:10,496
Right so he's teeth concerned that any error that you get from each one of those steps will accumulate

1780
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:17,408
I mean I definitely felt like I even saw the community when I saw Adam playing cuz I noticed that he's fully like drift

1781
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:19,456
Playing

1782
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:22,528
Have arrows and you like rotate throughout the tower

1783
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:28,928
You're not moving from the tower not moving around the tower and then you just like

1784
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:35,328
Basically sniping these balloons and like these nights or something I noticed about him playing the game he's fully migrated

1785
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:37,632
Yeah that was from the lab

1786
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:40,704
I guess the big thing though is that

1787
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:44,032
With the lighthouses the magic is that they do know

1788
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:45,824
With absolute terms

1789
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:49,664
Where you are too I don't know what the actual number is I guess it's probably like

1790
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:54,016
Down to about a centimeter probably or better

1791
02:32:54,272 --> 02:33:00,416
Sorry I said the lighthouses no I mean the computer knows where you are in some kind

1792
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:06,816
I don't even know this and knowing exactly the space in between

1793
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:08,096
Sensor 1 Sensor 2

1794
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:10,912
But I'm saying

1795
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:12,448
What do you mean

1796
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:13,472
So

1797
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:15,264
Eat soy

1798
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:21,664
How is this related to how are these two ideas really okay when you have this based on this based on this base

1799
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:28,064
Based on this based on their on their way

1800
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:34,208
Not air will accumulate over time

1801
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:37,536
But what I'm saying is that you can

1802
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:41,632
The it is possible at least that's what valve is

1803
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:43,168
I think doing

1804
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:48,544
To determine clearly with some effort after a couple samples

1805
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:50,848
I'm like if you just pick up

1806
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:53,408
The Watchmen controller turn it on

1807
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,712
It will know where you are

1808
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:58,016
Eventually or where it is eventually

1809
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:04,928
So there is clearly some way to get started though that's an interesting this really has an interesting point because

1810
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:09,024
Pending on the way this works I don't know what maybe

1811
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:10,304
I can tell us would be

1812
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:13,632
Better than the naive approach that I was doing or not

1813
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:20,032
Different far as getting just checking up to when I understand

1814
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:25,408
The first thing I hear that's different that's very large is that you're actually using units of like centimeters or meters or something

1815
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:31,808
Don't leave it that what you have to do in order to add that what I'm talking about

1816
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:38,208
Two units away from each other it just you know that they're supposed to be

1817
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:43,328
A certain amount of Click of time which Associates to like

1818
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:45,888
How much is that like

1819
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:47,680
Half a foot 6 inches or something

1820
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:54,080
And so if it's 6 inches away and it's a certain position in space

1821
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:58,688
Maybe between the two lighthouses then you

1822
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:01,248
You know that it should hits like

1823
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:09,440
5 Ms apart I have no idea what the actual timing supposed to be

1824
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:12,000
You are correct you can calculate the absolute Z

1825
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,816
Basically from the lighthouse

1826
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:17,376
From sensors 2A and 2B

1827
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:20,960
And it will not accumulate are overtime

1828
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:27,360
Because

1829
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:29,920
The depth to the lighthouse with those two

1830
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:32,736
Pointed out that makes sense to me because

1831
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:38,112
So that'll give you some level of ground truth because if I have an angle that's exactly that

1832
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:45,280
Because if I do it like this I'm like okay now I know that the

1833
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:51,680
Just part of my hand is this far from it but then like say it's actually to skew then we'll now it's like

1834
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:58,080
. so it's ambiguous could be anywhere along

1835
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:05,504
Was it better like no he does not

1836
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,296
He is not a valve

1837
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:13,952
Because you know that that was actually the biggest reason I thought that we didn't need

1838
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:20,352
The actual distance in Lexington or whatever to the lighthouse because you had that issue if what if you initialize it

1839
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:28,288
Our listeners would be like our lighthouses pointing up can you see me so is playing up there

1840
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:31,872
But this isn't even straight on

1841
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:38,272
So you don't have what's the triangle whenever it's two equal sides and one up

1842
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:40,064
Please

1843
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:44,416
So you needn't have an isosceles triangular if you got that actual distance in like

1844
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:50,816
There's only one particular case maybe two facing the other direction to the lighthouse to particular exact

1845
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:57,216
K12

1846
02:36:57,472 --> 02:37:03,616
Essentially wear your exactly head on to the lighthouse

1847
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:06,432
You'll be able to figure out the death

1848
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:10,272
But you have to be like

1849
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:14,368
I think you can use more information about

1850
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,416
So like if you know

1851
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:23,072
That that like this latest sorry this photo died here the so did I just hear this phone did I hear this

1852
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:29,472
And you know that that particular thing then if you watch all of them at least so what I'm trying to do

1853
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:35,616
Do with my lighthouse thing I think that's what I'm doing I think that's why I'm able to tell depth well but not perspective

1854
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:38,176
But it still works

1855
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:40,736
From this point of view over here

1856
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:43,040
Like from from right here

1857
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:45,856
That has a different configuration

1858
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:48,160
Like what that looks like

1859
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:54,816
Then it does straight on it's not just put like $3 be further or closer it's that it's a completely different configurations

1860
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:56,352
See you can kind of

1861
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,888
Tell the difference

1862
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:05,568
Yeah I know sorry that the other thing was that I Mindy's correct the scale is defined by the constellation geometry

1863
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:07,616
The base emissions are

1864
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:10,688
Angular fractions of time

1865
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:16,320
And by the way that was before ologist and you can definitely get this time

1866
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:28,608
Yeah I like maybe I could keep Matthew and get this until I still don't understand why you need like an absolute distance

1867
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:35,008
I think the absolute so when Adam was playing in the game I would be surprised if it was drifting I think he was just kind of War.

1868
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:37,312
Around or walking around or something

1869
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:42,432
Cuz I think about like a like a space pirate trainer

1870
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:43,712
We're like

1871
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:48,576
In addition when you walk towards the wall it will draw the wall in front of you

1872
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:54,976
Like the physical wall will be drawn in the VR display when you get close to the virtual wall

1873
02:38:58,048 --> 02:39:02,656
But so it still has to know in absolute terms with respect to say the wall

1874
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:04,704
Where Were You Are

1875
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:10,336
Otherwise how does it know how far close to Milwaukie or

1876
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:14,944
To the wall you are because you drew the wall with your sensors and it marks

1877
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:21,344
And if you go back to this thingy you have this static Cartesian system and so you basically mark

1878
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,648
Hey I know my room is

1879
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,672
Like

1880
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:30,304
Here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here

1881
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:35,168
And so you have a picture in this

1882
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:36,448
System

1883
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:39,776
About where your room is

1884
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:43,616
And then everything exist without room and if all of a sudden

1885
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:47,712
Your sensors noticed that you're trying to like approach

1886
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:51,040
This point over here it knows that you're not supposed to be at

1887
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,064
Tu

1888
02:39:52,832 --> 02:39:57,440
Chowan equals 22 equals 4

1889
02:39:57,696 --> 02:40:00,256
Right I guess though like how does it know

1890
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:02,816
Start in the middle

1891
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:10,752
I'm sorry that I'm not

1892
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:11,520
In the middle

1893
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:14,848
And then you're like making motions overtime

1894
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:17,664
Like like over that way

1895
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:24,064
Draw the wall or walking around

1896
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:25,344
I can try pretty good

1897
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,160
But it's some point I have to know

1898
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:34,560
On that like okay I'm getting cuz like I already drew it within the same frame but I do have to know that I am getting close to the

1899
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:40,960
Right so then is just like oh we recognize that your team 7

1900
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:43,776
She want equals 72 equals

1901
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:45,056
That is

1902
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:46,336
5

1903
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:53,248
And so we know that that's getting here so we're going to go ahead and run to the wall whenever you're at like this

1904
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,528
Slightly

1905
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:57,088
Inside the wall point

1906
02:40:57,344 --> 02:41:03,488
But that still relies on like if this starts drifting over time like that then 10 minutes in the middle

1907
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,816
And like these are start accumulating as I walk around

1908
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:13,472
I still need to know and like I would imagine they're going to accumulate on like at least several inches below

1909
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:19,872
Those were saying sometimes I do there is definitely drifting sometimes they're saying it's actually not fresh and so we need to stick

1910
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:26,272
The real system doesn't have craft store

1911
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:29,344
I'm saying the way that the real system is implemented

1912
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:36,000
If there is small errors from whatever frame to frame it does not incur long-term

1913
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:37,792
Dr. fauci says

1914
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:39,584
God dammit where's my clipboard

1915
02:41:40,864 --> 02:41:47,008
Oh no is he going to do another passive Twitter diagrammer

1916
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:56,736
What is the clipboard mean what behavior is coming back that was the one where we got our first hint

1917
02:41:56,992 --> 02:42:01,856
For like you know like they do this thing with the lights and they will tell you how to

1918
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:08,512
How to do what you're after

1919
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:11,072
That's why I

1920
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:15,424
And the system will show you why you're wrong

1921
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,192
Okay

1922
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:20,800
I don't know

1923
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:29,504
Present my base hypotheses with the simplest situations

1924
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:31,808
And then you can chew on that

1925
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:35,136
Visit interesting places

1926
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:36,416
This does make

1927
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:42,560
So one of the things dr. Yates wanted me to do was to look at the

1928
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:46,656
To look at it with the ways we did in the cabin with the one

1929
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:52,544
Lighthouse pointed at the camera right

1930
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:56,128
Not helpful for me for thinking of this

1931
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:04,832
Different I don't know if anything I'm going to take offline to

1932
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:05,856
Thoroughly

1933
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:06,880
Thanks bro

1934
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:13,280
But like I feel like there's a lot of value in thinking about it this way cuz it does give you Deltas between the things very accurately

1935
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:14,816
I don't know

1936
02:43:15,328 --> 02:43:16,864
I guess I just don't know if it's

1937
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:22,240
Getting absolute position I feel like it's

1938
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,264
Better

1939
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:30,944
I know for me it's just it's so easy to be able to draw a line out from the the lighthouse if I know it lighthouses but I don't know what

1940
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:37,600
I don't know

1941
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:39,904
Is Chat thing anything else

1942
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:47,328
Should I go I don't know people are saying we need a great job

1943
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,352
Mothers

1944
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:55,008
Some general questions possible Run the official room setup without two controllers come in late trying to understand

1945
02:43:55,264 --> 02:43:56,544
What's going on pattern

1946
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:02,944
Sorry that this that we will be making the stream available later

1947
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:10,112
Right now I am trying to go against title of the stream and I'm trying to say that we don't need to know where the lighthouses are

1948
02:44:10,368 --> 02:44:16,512
Intitle Loosely exactly like okra and a bunch of stuff is busted we need to fix it

1949
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:22,912
Let's collect some data and fix them

1950
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:25,728
Reminder fix megabox

1951
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:26,752
Metro

1952
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:30,336
Okay

1953
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:38,784
Does anybody in chat currently have any data that they would like collected if that would make it really easy

1954
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:43,136
You guys actually have something you want done or you want day 24 or something like that

1955
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:49,792
I can totally do that is anybody in chat right now who's actively working on with these problems on their own and

1956
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:51,840
Wish that they had access to some more data

1957
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:01,824
Top Golf

1958
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:03,104
What's going on

1959
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,152
Can't even

1960
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:10,016
Or anybody nobody in chat no data

1961
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:11,808
Nothing so far

1962
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:16,672
How to test put a headset at one end of a measuring stick it in the other

1963
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:21,536
Absolute chords to know where things are relative to each other

1964
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:24,608
Measuring stick

1965
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:26,656
Organic sounds like

1966
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:33,568
Try to correlate that data to an absolute measurement so yeah they're trying to figure out if the data is in like a kind

1967
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:35,616
Standard unit that we would

1968
02:45:35,872 --> 02:45:36,384
Be able to

1969
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:39,200
Figure out like using a measuring stick

1970
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:43,296
Looks like

1971
02:45:44,064 --> 02:45:44,576
Tom

1972
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:50,720
So what would you like Paul what what kind of data would you want me to take cuz I can easily take

1973
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:55,072
Like really looks like we got the headset to coming back to

1974
02:45:55,328 --> 02:46:01,472
I can take the headset data and it will give you the the relative angles from a specific lighthouses point of view

1975
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:06,335
A different positions is that that would you like Paul

1976
02:46:13,759 --> 02:46:19,135
TCL 98 7987 says can you get the absolute coordinates

1977
02:46:19,647 --> 02:46:23,999
I walked by recording a walk around the room in the official room setup

1978
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:25,023
I don't know

1979
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:32,447
Collect this stand in the middle of room

1980
02:46:32,703 --> 02:46:38,847
Richard 360-degrees on-the-spot

1981
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:46,271
Question about that rotation wines you cuz if we put the headset on and then we rotate that will require it being like

1982
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:52,671
Butternut Circle or do you just want to like sit here and then along like this particular

1983
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:59,071
Sensor rotate along or just like take the entire like

1984
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:09,055
Here

1985
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:25,695
Okay when I say absolute

1986
02:47:25,951 --> 02:47:29,791
Removing the

1987
02:47:30,047 --> 02:47:34,143
Stopping real quick whiteboard

1988
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:41,055
Whatever this is

1989
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,871
Horribly bad

1990
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:46,943
I'm going to move your math

1991
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:52,831
The chat is saying more rather than absolute coordinates it looking like coordinates in the real world

1992
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:57,951
Okay okay so here's what I was trying to

1993
02:47:58,207 --> 02:48:00,511
This off

1994
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:04,607
Coordinates without attached

1995
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:09,983
Alexa.

1996
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:16,383
Pretty Jank for you I am the king of Jank

1997
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:19,711
Yeah

1998
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:26,879
After I still didn't see the backside of the units

1999
02:48:27,903 --> 02:48:31,743
Okay so what I'm trying to say when I say absolute terms I mean

2000
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:34,047
I will just decide for this particular room

2001
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:35,071
Like right now

2002
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:41,471
What I'm going to do is I'm going to set up

2003
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:47,871
I think you have a particular space in this room that you reference as 00 and the Cartesian coordinate system

2004
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:50,687
This is a coordinate frame

2005
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,223
This is

2006
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:56,319
One Charles by one Charles by one Charles by 1 Charles

2007
02:48:57,599 --> 02:48:59,903
And you can see I can pick it up when I can move around

2008
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:02,975
Imaginary light right here

2009
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:05,279
You're moving your entire cortesian

2010
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:08,351
Okay I am right now but but but but

2011
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:09,631
Now I'm not now

2012
02:49:11,423 --> 02:49:13,983
Now I'm so right now

2013
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:20,383
I can I can say pretend that I have a wall that starts right over there goes there there there there

2014
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:21,663
Uni Nashua

2015
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:24,223
I have a pretend wall to

2016
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:28,575
Okay you drew it with your

2017
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:31,903
Once Okay so we've already set up the wall

2018
02:49:32,415 --> 02:49:33,183
Yes okay

2019
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:34,207
Okay

2020
02:49:34,463 --> 02:49:35,231
So now

2021
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:37,279
I want to render it for the person

2022
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:41,119
Yes and

2023
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:44,191
Play Shawty Imagining the spaces unity3d

2024
02:49:44,703 --> 02:49:45,471
Yes

2025
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:51,359
So in order to I have to have a camera in the in the Sea Bright

2026
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:59,807
Let me know everything

2027
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:00,575
Well

2028
02:50:00,831 --> 02:50:02,623
Can't see anything unless there's a camera

2029
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:09,535
But is there a camera or are there multiple cameras

2030
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:15,167
There are two cameras on One camera assembly

2031
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:18,239
There two cameras one for each eye

2032
02:50:20,031 --> 02:50:21,055
Okay so that's

2033
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:24,895
And then the idea would be that in order to display the wall

2034
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:29,247
From my perspective you're saying that you could

2035
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:34,879
And you kind of start with like saying that okay to head is when we start we're starting a 2000

2036
02:50:35,135 --> 02:50:41,279
And we have incremental updates as we move along but move us around in this coordinate frame start with the

2037
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:42,559
Is it right here

2038
02:50:42,815 --> 02:50:44,863
And we can golfer the transforms for that

2039
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:46,911
I just worry that overtime

2040
02:50:48,703 --> 02:50:49,215
Like

2041
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:55,359
That wall that I'm drawing in front of me which will track perfectly to begin with Hillcrest start to drift over that way so

2042
02:50:55,615 --> 02:51:00,991
Or some way

2043
02:51:02,015 --> 02:51:04,063
And so I guess that's where I'm coming from

2044
02:51:04,831 --> 02:51:07,647
The value that I think that

2045
02:51:08,415 --> 02:51:14,559
What flight variable piece of technology pieces Mass where it where are you worried about that dripped out

2046
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:18,655
Oh what you mean the cause of it

2047
02:51:19,423 --> 02:51:19,935
Yes

2048
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:20,703
Okay

2049
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:23,263
So whenever those things to say

2050
02:51:23,519 --> 02:51:29,663
Right now your photodiode is right here actually that way and sometimes

2051
02:51:29,919 --> 02:51:35,807
That way it's really over there a little bit little bit or not

2052
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:36,831
Perfect

2053
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:43,743
They've stabilized to ridiculous amounts of sounds like

2054
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:46,559
1 something arcseconds like

2055
02:51:47,071 --> 02:51:49,631
I don't remember what it is

2056
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:52,447
Itty bitty idiot Nvidia now

2057
02:51:52,703 --> 02:51:55,519
But you get that update 60 times a second

2058
02:51:58,079 --> 02:51:58,847
And

2059
02:51:59,103 --> 02:52:01,919
So for every single time say it's like okay well it was

2060
02:52:02,175 --> 02:52:04,735
A little bit that way that way

2061
02:52:05,247 --> 02:52:09,087
I just had a question about what is the are crashing look like for fun

2062
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:10,367
What do you mean

2063
02:52:11,391 --> 02:52:17,535
Sounds like it has some crazy are correction algorithms happy on top of the other things that are already happening so I don't what it is

2064
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:21,887
That's why they're so important

2065
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:27,775
Yeah but why aren't

2066
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:34,943
They're talking about a diagram that got those little earlier up here let me look this

2067
02:52:41,599 --> 02:52:42,623
I'm sorry

2068
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:45,439
Have a horrible in Spanish why you asked

2069
02:52:46,207 --> 02:52:47,999
Where does the air come from or something like that

2070
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:54,399
That's why that's so important because they're constantly

2071
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:59,007
Tracking for that dress even constantly maybe like once every

2072
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:01,311
50 seconds or once every like

2073
02:53:01,823 --> 02:53:07,455
360 Cycles or something

2074
02:53:08,223 --> 02:53:14,367
I think that they're doing corrections but I don't think that they're going to be able to get the air down

2075
02:53:14,623 --> 02:53:20,767
Do like the over several minutes the integrated like every single time

2076
02:53:21,023 --> 02:53:22,815
Keep track of the original position

2077
02:53:23,583 --> 02:53:29,215
How they do that

2078
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:33,567
Just remember one thing

2079
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:36,639
Pretend that the method down there

2080
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:40,479
Okay well what have you started

2081
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:43,551
So it was that right here

2082
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:49,951
And then we figure out where the cameras are and then we move around so then the headset to find the coordinate frame but what

2083
02:53:50,207 --> 02:53:52,511
I'm thinking right now is weed stupid heads at right there

2084
02:53:53,023 --> 02:53:54,047
And then

2085
02:53:54,815 --> 02:53:56,351
As we move it

2086
02:53:57,119 --> 02:54:00,959
El between each other relatives to the okay if we had a single lighthouse

2087
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:05,823
What I was imagining was

2088
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:09,407
If we had if we had started with the right here but then now it's over here

2089
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:14,783
So now we have a Delta before change between this to this and this and this today

2090
02:54:15,039 --> 02:54:18,367
So from there to here now we can define a relative

2091
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:20,159
Rotation

2092
02:54:20,415 --> 02:54:21,183
Catch

2093
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:22,207
All of that stuff

2094
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:24,255
Yes yes

2095
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:25,023
Okay

2096
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:26,303
So now

2097
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:28,351
We can then get this an absolute Court

2098
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:35,775
If I did find this right here is 000

2099
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:37,823
And now it's here

2100
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:41,663
Now it's actually 001

2101
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:46,271
Is that what absolute is for you that's absolute for me

2102
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:51,135
That is also relative right now

2103
02:54:51,647 --> 02:54:54,719
My entire world

2104
02:54:55,743 --> 02:54:59,327
Revolves around this coordinate frame that I made several years ago

2105
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:00,351
So

2106
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:07,007
Like to me this is absolutely 001

2107
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:08,799
But not necessarily

2108
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:10,591
001 m

2109
02:55:12,383 --> 02:55:18,527
In this particular case where I am holding it this is 001m

2110
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:22,111
This is

2111
02:55:23,135 --> 02:55:25,439
And you care about it being one m

2112
02:55:26,207 --> 02:55:29,279
And you know that it's 1 M because

2113
02:55:31,839 --> 02:55:35,935
Because if I'm going to present it from this point to be right here

2114
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:41,567
It would look different than this point to be right here how do you know that it's a m decks

2115
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:47,199
One thing I would need to know the right place in the unity 3D environment

2116
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:54,623
Do we want to

2117
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:57,439
You want to move on I don't know I think we're kind of did the

2118
02:55:57,951 --> 02:55:59,743
Contemporary dance

2119
02:55:59,999 --> 02:56:01,791
Is that okay okay

2120
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:04,607
John Q U

2121
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:07,679
That picture at me or something

2122
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:08,959
Show diagram

2123
02:56:09,727 --> 02:56:12,799
I mean I don't know I just know that it's kind of

2124
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:19,455
Don't know I've never managed this before I'm not a professional

2125
02:56:19,711 --> 02:56:21,247
Resend I can click on it

2126
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:24,575
Oh my God people are saying so much stuff

2127
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:27,391
Probably you're getting overwhelmed you need to like

2128
02:56:27,903 --> 02:56:29,439
Taken what we can take on

2129
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:33,279
Yeah we might want to end the live stream soon

2130
02:56:33,791 --> 02:56:37,375
Let me mention wanting to actually get data though

2131
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:39,167
If you can

2132
02:56:40,447 --> 02:56:44,031
Can just mention back in the chat again what day do you like and then we can try to

2133
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:50,687
At least do something we said we would do this live stream

2134
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:52,991
Like tasks essentially right

2135
02:56:53,247 --> 02:56:56,575
Oh yeah

2136
02:56:57,087 --> 02:57:03,231
Oh yeah that's a good point if you guys want something to Dad at ask for it and I'll go do it in fact we don't have to wait for the livestream for me to do

2137
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:03,999
Anytime

2138
02:57:05,023 --> 02:57:07,583
Okay so I have open here wow

2139
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:10,143
I have open here images

2140
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:12,703
Well hold on let me go

2141
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:14,495
Resize the camera again

2142
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:17,055
I need to process this

2143
02:57:22,175 --> 02:57:27,551
By the way I think I have an answer for the meter question but I was waiting

2144
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:28,831
Which was

2145
02:57:30,623 --> 02:57:31,647
Oh you mean later

2146
02:57:33,439 --> 02:57:36,511
I mean either way I can do it now or later

2147
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:42,399
Okay so I have brought up this diagram who made the diagram

2148
02:57:42,655 --> 02:57:44,447
Let me find it

2149
02:57:44,703 --> 02:57:46,751
Take a picture first

2150
02:57:50,847 --> 02:57:53,919
They roll

2151
02:57:54,175 --> 02:57:55,455
Oh okay

2152
02:57:55,711 --> 02:58:01,855
Negril are Nightcrawler I don't know how to pronounce your name is the one who's responsible for documenting

2153
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:07,487
The great volume of information that we know in the community about the

2154
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:09,023
About the vibe

2155
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:14,911
So that diagram that's up on the screen they're Night Raw I don't know what I'm looking at

2156
02:58:15,423 --> 02:58:21,567
It looks like a chart of the headset the two points on it that you're viewing from

2157
02:58:22,847 --> 02:58:27,199
Do you think you understand you should probably go sit in my chair and pipe up

2158
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:32,063
Lonely sort of shore

2159
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:36,159
Maybe neither all can start using some more words okay hold on

2160
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:42,559
The original context it was posted if I understand that correctly than they want to solve the inscribed angle theorem in 3D space

2161
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:44,351
The lighthouse

2162
02:58:44,607 --> 02:58:48,703
Like this but in 3D so this is a 2d

2163
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:51,263
Example of what he is discussing

2164
02:58:51,519 --> 02:58:53,311
Okay

2165
02:58:53,567 --> 02:58:55,615
Nairobi Jake

2166
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:57,407
BK Tuesday

2167
02:58:57,663 --> 02:59:02,783
The inscribed angle says that if I know the angle between two points in their distance I can find the circle

2168
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:06,111
With the two points in the Observer sit on

2169
02:59:06,367 --> 02:59:07,647
That was my state point

2170
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:10,207
Forget about the PNC

2171
02:59:10,463 --> 02:59:11,999
Forget about CNG

2172
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:21,215
The trailer Hidden they exist they're just not visible

2173
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:46,047
He has Paul Martin says I would like you to put the HDMI location and Reapers that

2174
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:49,119
Repositioning the status of the way for instance one

2175
02:59:49,375 --> 02:59:50,399
1 / yard

2176
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:58,591
Paul do I need to just start it at our magical coordinate frame and then move it up one meter like I was suggesting and pointing at a

2177
02:59:58,847 --> 02:59:59,871
Pacific camera

2178
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:03,967
Do we have a new person

2179
03:00:04,735 --> 03:00:06,527
We have a tape measure

2180
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:14,463
I wish we had a meter stick though but we're in America

2181
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:16,511
Staples baby in order

2182
03:00:17,535 --> 03:00:23,679
Not now we will try to take us off and Packer says I'd like to hear the answer

2183
03:00:25,215 --> 03:00:31,359
You mean termini's M question I believe so

2184
03:00:31,615 --> 03:00:37,759
If anybody else in chat has any good explanation as to why

2185
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:44,159
The absolute Physicians matter that would be really good because I don't know how to explain my understanding of

2186
03:00:51,839 --> 03:00:54,143
My opinion is that I've been through

2187
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:57,471
Moderating chat I haven't been following walkthrough disgusting

2188
03:00:57,727 --> 03:01:00,287
A little tired and

2189
03:01:00,799 --> 03:01:01,567
I feel like

2190
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:07,967
There are better head to the task than mine but I'm sorry

2191
03:01:12,575 --> 03:01:18,719
Paul says that Mindy the reason we want to M because he wants position I we want to position in real space

2192
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:27,167
I also tried to talk to OK Google

2193
03:01:27,423 --> 03:01:33,567
Oh wait

2194
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:39,199
What was Mindy's answer to the m question

2195
03:01:39,455 --> 03:01:45,599
Okay she is reading up on the Whiteboard

2196
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:51,999
Okay tell you what are you guys okay with us just trying to

2197
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:55,839
Do another live stream sooner than later and just ending the soon

2198
03:01:57,119 --> 03:02:03,263
I don't know I don't know what what is what is everybody's feelings I can just keep doing this indefinitely

2199
03:02:04,543 --> 03:02:09,663
Cuz next weekend

2200
03:02:10,431 --> 03:02:16,575
And then I have something planned for the weekend after and then

2201
03:02:16,831 --> 03:02:21,695
I know

2202
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:25,279
That's why I'm irritated

2203
03:02:29,375 --> 03:02:35,519
But I know it's going to be at least three days after magfest before I'm coherent again

2204
03:02:35,775 --> 03:02:38,335
The entire weekend awake and heavily drunk

2205
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:51,903
Figure out how to explain that last bit there are because I was just like

2206
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:54,207
Distracted and tired

2207
03:02:54,463 --> 03:03:00,607
That looks like most people are fine with us and they can do another one

2208
03:03:00,863 --> 03:03:02,399
If you can

2209
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:04,703
Mini quickly write off

2210
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:11,103
Your explanation says people can see it then we'll just call it a

2211
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:12,639
After that

2212
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:15,199
So am I whiteboarding in front of the internet now

2213
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:22,879
Yes you can wait for it off to the side or in front of the internet if you want I guess no not at all

2214
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:33,375
Let me think for a second cuz I'm of the food sometimes just me staring off into space

2215
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:53,087
Have a picture

2216
03:03:53,343 --> 03:03:56,159
Laptop and just plug in SD card

2217
03:03:56,415 --> 03:04:01,791
SD cards

2218
03:04:07,679 --> 03:04:10,495
Okay do you have do you have the thing or not

2219
03:04:10,751 --> 03:04:12,031
Everything

2220
03:04:12,287 --> 03:04:18,431
The the thing that you do not have a reader

2221
03:04:25,087 --> 03:04:31,231
Okay

2222
03:04:31,487 --> 03:04:37,631
Play Paul's test start at 1 position

2223
03:04:44,287 --> 03:04:50,431
Sorry for you

2224
03:04:50,687 --> 03:04:56,831
Making terrible jokes well Paul remember I was not the first person to do this

2225
03:04:57,087 --> 03:05:03,231
And on top of that my role was definitely I guess as far as anybody from

2226
03:05:03,487 --> 03:05:09,631
Give him the biggest props because the Spanx if it wasn't for his work

2227
03:05:09,887 --> 03:05:16,031
Early on then nobody would have gotten anywhere I would just looked at it been like well nobody knows anything not going to do it

2228
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:22,431
Cuz I'm willing to work I just you know I'm not willing to be the first

2229
03:05:22,687 --> 03:05:28,831
I'm polite just updated your thing anybody else have anything

2230
03:05:29,087 --> 03:05:35,231
Anything else that we need to focus on now

2231
03:05:35,487 --> 03:05:41,375
Think that's why I don't think there's that much

2232
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:45,983
What is the total length of the LifeStream

2233
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:52,383
Cuz I don't even have a Time

2234
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:58,783
So we can totally consider should we could probably cut it now and then we'll see

2235
03:05:59,039 --> 03:06:05,183
Where we can get after it doesn't make sense we will do another brief video

2236
03:06:06,719 --> 03:06:12,863
I mean I guess what we really need

2237
03:06:13,119 --> 03:06:19,263
This point is like a chat room or something I will say this chord chord

2238
03:06:19,519 --> 03:06:23,103
Scored for us pretty much the same thing

2239
03:06:23,359 --> 03:06:29,503
No voice chat

2240
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:34,879
Images in all it's pretty much the same

2241
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:41,279
I know you just how can you give an estimate of the next Vice gris-gris dream before cut

2242
03:06:41,535 --> 03:06:47,679
What do you mean by an estimate of the next live stream

2243
03:06:47,935 --> 03:06:54,079
The next one be like oh that's really rough with the problem is next the next week is

2244
03:06:54,335 --> 03:07:00,479
Bakery preparation for magfest and then magfest is the weekend after this coming one and is Monday night

2245
03:07:00,735 --> 03:07:05,343
Shmoocon which I think she's involved with so it's there's just no way

2246
03:07:12,255 --> 03:07:18,399
I don't have the data plan for in my work, Oregon

2247
03:07:18,655 --> 03:07:24,799
Okay there's enough people here who are excited for the prospect of training at mag.

2248
03:07:25,055 --> 03:07:31,199
Sounds like we're going to stream two weeks from tonight

2249
03:07:31,455 --> 03:07:34,527
Get a space in the living room cut out for us to use the Vive

2250
03:07:34,783 --> 03:07:40,927
Okay we can we we will try to stream live from magfest two weeks from tonight

2251
03:07:41,183 --> 03:07:42,463
I may be drunk

2252
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:48,863
Just a heads up and if anybody else like you guys can make it out to magfest that would be

2253
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:51,423
Super cool to meet up with some of you guys

2254
03:07:54,239 --> 03:08:00,383
Probably find out if they're at Mike that I'm pretty sure they're going to go find us I hope you

2255
03:08:00,639 --> 03:08:05,503
Greenland room like

2256
03:08:05,759 --> 03:08:11,903
Comeuppance

2257
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:18,303
Man I man please enjoy magfest but dreams are Pleasant

2258
03:08:18,559 --> 03:08:24,703
Magfest will have a blast

2259
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:31,103
End up going on tour somewhere else to do it may not stick just to the Vive at that point

2260
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:37,503
We may end up switching to streaming from a phone and just walking

2261
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:40,319
Around

2262
03:08:45,183 --> 03:08:51,327
No hate Mindy this is coming at you might find useful the

2263
03:08:53,119 --> 03:08:55,423
Alphabet just posted this year

2264
03:08:57,983 --> 03:09:04,127
Alphabet

2265
03:09:04,383 --> 03:09:10,527
Play Packer I could not see the face I had no idea I thought

2266
03:09:10,783 --> 03:09:16,927
Sorry I'm I thought there was going to be like

2267
03:09:17,183 --> 03:09:18,207
Google

2268
03:09:19,999 --> 03:09:21,535
The circle is that I've

2269
03:09:23,839 --> 03:09:29,983
The four dots are the sensors that are tracked these sensors have known distances from each other yes

2270
03:09:31,007 --> 03:09:37,151
That's the beginning of my talk yes this is simply straight on you yep sensors are farther apart

2271
03:09:41,759 --> 03:09:46,623
I didn't draw pictures pictures this is exactly what's happening

2272
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:53,791
And this Vive is the same distance but since the Thompsons are closer they do know the vibe is looking up

2273
03:09:54,047 --> 03:09:55,327
Yasso rotation

2274
03:09:59,423 --> 03:10:00,703
Pictures again

2275
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:03,007

03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:10,175
Rob bumpers also makes me good suggestion to post the Discord won't stop indicate help

2277
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:16,575
Okay so you guys are up for Discord and on the issues and all

2278
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:22,975
And it does sound like it makes sense of parallel paths I would be totally up for something it says not determined look

2279
03:10:23,231 --> 03:10:24,511
Locations of lighthouses

2280
03:10:24,767 --> 03:10:30,655
Provided I mean I care a great deal about I think I care about absolute positions

2281
03:10:31,679 --> 03:10:34,751
We will have to stay

2282
03:10:36,031 --> 03:10:37,567
Okay yes

2283
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:43,967
How long will it take we could probably just leave this created it right now

2284
03:10:44,223 --> 03:10:49,343
Okay can you also do you mind I think you can just do a push pull request on GitHub and then it'll just

2285
03:10:49,599 --> 03:10:50,879

2286
03:10:51,647 --> 03:10:54,207

03:12:01,023 --> 03:12:07,167

2298
03:12:07,423 --> 03:12:08,447
Keep discussion

2299
03:12:08,959 --> 03:12:11,775
